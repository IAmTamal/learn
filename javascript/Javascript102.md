# What is the difference between Call, Apply and Bind

The difference between Call, Apply and Bind can be explained with below examples,

**Call:** The call() method invokes a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided one by one

```javascript
var employee1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Rodson" };
var employee2 = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Baily" };
function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
  console.log(
    greeting1 + " " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", " + greeting2
  );
}
invite.call(employee1, "Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello John Rodson, How you?
invite.call(employee2, "Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How you?
```

**Apply:** Invokes the function with a given `this` value and allows you to pass in arguments as an array

```javascript
var employee1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Rodson" };
var employee2 = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Baily" };

function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
  console.log(
    greeting1 + " " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", " + greeting2
  );
}

invite.apply(employee1, ["Hello", "How are you?"]); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
invite.apply(employee2, ["Hello", "How are you?"]); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
```

**bind:** returns a new function, allowing you to pass any number of arguments

```javascript
var employee1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Rodson" };
var employee2 = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Baily" };

function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
  console.log(
    greeting1 + " " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", " + greeting2
  );
}

var inviteEmployee1 = invite.bind(employee1);
var inviteEmployee2 = invite.bind(employee2);
inviteEmployee1("Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
inviteEmployee2("Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
```

Call and apply are pretty interchangeable. Both execute the current function immediately. You need to decide whether it‚Äôs easier to send in an array or a comma separated list of arguments. You can remember by treating Call is for **comma** (separated list) and Apply is for **Array**.

Whereas Bind creates a new function that will have `this` set to the first parameter passed to bind().

  

# What is JSON and its common operations

**JSON** is a text-based data format following JavaScript object syntax, which was popularized by `Douglas Crockford`. It is useful when you want to transmit data across a network and it is basically just a text file with an extension of .json, and a MIME type of application/json

**Parsing:** Converting a string to a native object

```javascript
JSON.parse(text);
```

**Stringification:** converting a native object to a string so it can be transmitted across the network

```javascript
JSON.stringify(object);
```

# Slice, Splice üëáüèª

## What is the purpose of the array slice method

The **slice()** method returns the selected elements in an array as a new array object. It selects the elements starting at the given start argument, and ends at the given optional end argument without including the last element. If you omit the second argument then it selects till the end.

Some of the examples of this method are,

```javascript
   let arrayIntegers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   let arrayIntegers1 = arrayIntegers.slice(0, 2); // returns [1,2]
   let arrayIntegers2 = arrayIntegers.slice(2, 3); // returns [3]
   let arrayIntegers3 = arrayIntegers.slice(4); //returns [5]
```

**Note:** Slice method won't mutate the original array but it returns the subset as a new array.

  

## What is the purpose of the array splice method

The **splice()** method is used either adds/removes items to/from an array, and then returns the removed item. The first argument specifies the array position for insertion or deletion whereas the optional second argument indicates the number of elements to be deleted. Each additional argument is added to the array.

   Some of the examples of this method are,

   ```javascript
   let arrayIntegersOriginal1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   let arrayIntegersOriginal2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   let arrayIntegersOriginal3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

   let arrayIntegers1 = arrayIntegersOriginal1.splice(0, 2); // returns [1, 2]; original array: [3, 4, 5]
   let arrayIntegers2 = arrayIntegersOriginal2.splice(3); // returns [4, 5]; original array: [1, 2, 3]
   let arrayIntegers3 = arrayIntegersOriginal3.splice(3, 1, "a", "b", "c"); //returns [4]; original array: [1, 2, 3, "a", "b", "c", 5]
   ```

   **Note:** Splice method modifies the original array too and returns the deleted array.

  

## What is the difference between slice and splice

Some of the major difference in a tabular form

| Slice                                        | Splice                                          |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Doesn't modify the original array(immutable) | Modifies the original array(mutable)            |
| Returns the subset of original array         | Returns the deleted elements as array           |
| Used to pick the elements from array         | Used to insert or delete elements to/from array |

  

# How do you compare Object and Map

**Objects** are similar to **Maps** in that both let you set keys to values, retrieve those values, delete keys, and detect whether something is stored at a key. Due to this reason, Objects have been used as Maps historically. But there are important differences that make using a Map preferable in certain cases.

1. The keys of an Object are Strings and Symbols, whereas they can be any value for a Map, including functions, objects, and any primitive.
2. The keys in Map are ordered while keys added to Object are not. Thus, when iterating over it, a Map object returns keys in order of insertion.
3. You can get the size of a Map easily with the size property, while the number of properties in an Object must be determined manually.
4. A Map is an iterable and can thus be directly iterated, whereas iterating over an Object requires obtaining its keys in some fashion iterating over them.
5. An Object has a prototype, so there are default keys in the map that could collide with your keys if you're not careful. As of ES5 this can bypassed by using map = Object.create(null), but this is seldom done.
6. A Map may perform better in scenarios involving frequent addition and removal of key pairs.

  

# What is the difference between == and === operators

JavaScript provides both strict(===, !==) and type-converting(==, !=) equality comparison. The strict operators take type of variable in consideration, while non-strict operators make type correction/conversion based upon values of variables. The strict operators follow the below conditions for different types,

1. Two strings are strictly equal when they have the same sequence of characters, same length, and same characters in corresponding positions.
2. Two numbers are strictly equal when they are numerically equal. i.e, Having the same number value.
      There are two special cases in this,
1. NaN is not equal to anything, including NaN.
2. Positive and negative zeros are equal to one another.
3. Two Boolean operands are strictly equal if both are true or both are false.


Some of the example which covers the above cases,

```javascript
0 == false   // true
0 === false  // false
1 == "1"     // true
1 === "1"    // false
null == undefined // true
null === undefined // false
'0' == false // true
'0' === false // false
[]==[] or []===[] //false, refer different objects in memory
{}=={} or {}==={} //false, refer different objects in memory
```



# Let VS Var

- Variables declared by let are only available inside the block where they‚Äôre defined.
- Variables declared by var are available throughout the function in which they‚Äôre declared.
  


```js
function varScoping() {
  var x = 1;

  if (true) {
    var x = 2;
    console.log(x); // will print 2
  }

  console.log(x); // will print 2
}

function letScoping() {
  let x = 1;

  if (true) {
    let x = 2;
    console.log(x); // will print 2
  }

  console.log(x); // will print 1
}

```

   

# How do you redeclare variables in switch block without an error

If you try to redeclare variables in a `switch block` then it will cause errors because there is only one block. For example, the below code block throws a syntax error as below,

```javascript
let counter = 1;
switch (x) {
  case 0:
    let name;
    break;  
    
  case 1:
    let name; // SyntaxError for redeclaration.
    break;
}
```

To avoid this error, you can create a nested block inside a case clause and create a new block scoped lexical environment.

```javascript
let counter = 1;
switch (x) {
  case 0: {
    let name;
    break;
  }
  case 1: {
    let name; // No SyntaxError for redeclaration.
    break;
  }
}
```

   

# What is memoization

Memoization in javascript is an optimization technique, to reduce the complexity of the application, runtime of the application, and proper utilization of resources (Time and Memory). The process consists of using an extra space (cache) for the reduction of expensive function calls (a function that recursively calls itself and it has some overlapping problem). By using memoization, we store the values that were calculated in the previously called subproblems. Then if the same subproblem is raised, we again use the stored value which reduces the time complexity as it removes the extra effort to calculate again and again for the same problem.
    

## How Does Memoization Work?

JavaScript Memoization mainly depends on two concepts:

- Closure
- High-order function

## Closure

The Closure is a combination of a function enclosed with its references to the state. A closure allows you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In javascript, at the time of function creation, the closure is generated.

## High Order Function

A higher-order function is a type of function that operates on other functions, they either take other functions as arguments or returns them.

## Importance of Memoization

- Memoization in javascript is an optimization technique that stores the results of function calls in a temporary data structure and then retrieves the results whenever the stored result is needed in the program. By doing this, the execution time is reduced and the CPU performance is increased

- Using Javascript Memoization we can reduce the time complexity of an application and by which the response time of the webpage will decreases (for eg. API call)


## When to Use Memoization?

- When the function is calling itself. i.e. for the recursive functions.
- When the function is pure (a function that returns the same value every time it is called). As if the value is different in each function call, then there will not be any use in storing such value. So, we can't use memoization in javascript when the function is impure.
- When the function is very complex in time(Heavy computation function). In this case, storing the results in a cache will increase the performance by reducing the time complexity, as re-computation for functions will not be performed.

   


   

   

# What is a service worker

A Service worker is basically a script (JavaScript file) that runs in the background, separate from a web page and provides features that don't need a web page or user interaction. Some of the major features of service workers are Rich offline experiences(offline first web application development), periodic background syncs, push notifications, intercept and handle network requests and programmatically managing a cache of responses.

   

# How do you manipulate DOM using a service worker

Service worker can't access the DOM directly. But it can communicate with the pages it controls by responding to messages sent via the `postMessage` interface, and those pages can manipulate the DOM.

   

# How do you reuse information across service worker restarts

The problem with service worker is that it gets terminated when not in use, and restarted when it's next needed, so you cannot rely on global state within a service worker's `onfetch` and `onmessage` handlers. In this case, service workers will have access to IndexedDB API in order to persist and reuse across restarts.
