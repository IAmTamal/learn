# What is Debouncing ? 

Debouncing is a programming practice used to ensure that time-consuming tasks do not fire so often, that it stalls the performance of the web page. In other words, it limits the rate at which a function gets invoked. Suppose we have an input box and we are constantly listening to the input event on that input box. Now, if we want to perform some action on every input event, then we can do that. But, if we want to perform some action after the user has stopped typing, then we can use debouncing.
