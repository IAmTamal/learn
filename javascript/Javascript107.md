# How do you flatten multi dimensional arrays

Flattening bi-dimensional arrays is trivial with Spread operator.

```javascript
const biDimensionalArr = [11, [22, 33], [44, 55], [66, 77], 88, 99];
const flattenArr = [].concat(...biDimensionalArr); // [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 6677, 88, 99]
```

But you can make it work with multi-dimensional arrays by recursive calls,

```javascript
function flattenMultiArray(arr) {
  const flattened = [].concat(...arr);
  return flattened.some((item) => Array.isArray(item))
    ? flattenMultiArray(flattened)
    : flattened;
}
const multiDimensionalArr = [11, [22, 33], [44, [55, 66, [77, [88]], 99]]];
const flatArr = flattenMultiArray(multiDimensionalArr); // [11, 22, 33, 44, 66, 77, 88, 99]
```
     
Also you can use the `flat` method of Array.
     
```javascript
const arr = [1, [2,3], 4, 5, [6,7]];
const fllattenArr = arr.flat(); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
     
// And for multiDemensional arrays
const multiDimensionalArr = [11, [22, 33], [44, [55, 66, [77, [88]], 99]]];
const oneStepFlat = multiDimensionalArr.flat(1); // [11, 22, 33, 44, [55, 66, [77, [88]], 99]]
const towStep = multiDimensionalArr.flat(2); // [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, [77, [88]], 99]
const fullyFlatArray = multiDimensionalArr.flat(Infinity); // [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99]
```

    

# What is the easiest multi condition checking

You can use `indexOf` to compare input with multiple values instead of checking each value as one condition.

```javascript
// Verbose approach
if (
input === "first" ||
input === 1 ||
input === "second" ||
input === 2
) {
someFunction();
}
// Shortcut
if (["first", 1, "second", 2].indexOf(input) !== -1) {
 someFunction();
}
```

    

# How do you capture browser back button

The `window.onbeforeunload` method is used to capture browser back button events. This is helpful to warn users about losing the current data.

```javascript
window.onbeforeunload = function () {
alert("You work will be lost");
};
```

    

# How do you disable right click in the web page

The right click on the page can be disabled by returning false from the `oncontextmenu` attribute on the body element.

```html
<body oncontextmenu="return false;"></body>
```

    

# What are wrapper objects

Primitive Values like string, number and boolean don't have properties and methods but they are temporarily converted or coerced to an object(Wrapper object) when you try to perform actions on them. For example, if you apply toUpperCase() method on a primitive string value, it does not throw an error but returns uppercase of the string.

```javascript
let name = "john";

console.log(name.toUpperCase());
```


Behind the scenes treated as `console.log(new String(name).toUpperCase());`

i.e, Every primitive except null and undefined have Wrapper Objects and the list of wrapper objects are String,Number,Boolean,Symbol and BigInt.

    

# What is AJAX

AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML and it is a group of related technologies(HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XMLHttpRequest API etc) used to display data asynchronously. i.e. We can send data to the server and get data from the server without reloading the web page.

    

# What are the different ways to deal with Asynchronous Code

Below are the list of different ways to deal with Asynchronous code.

 - Callbacks
 - Promises
 - Async/await
 - Third-party libraries such as async.js,bluebird etc

    


# How do you implement zero timeout in modern browsers

You can't use setTimeout(fn, 0) to execute the code immediately due to minimum delay of greater than 0ms. But you can use window.postMessage() to achieve this behavior.

    
# What are tasks in event loop

A task is any javascript code/program which is scheduled to be run by the standard mechanisms such as initially starting to run a program, run an event callback, or an interval or timeout being fired. All these tasks are scheduled on a task queue.
     Below are the list of use cases to add tasks to the task queue,

1. When a new javascript program is executed directly from console or running by `<script>` element, the task will be added to the task queue.
2. When an event fires, the event callback added to task queue
3. When a setTimeout or setInterval is reached, the corresponding callback added to task queue

    

# What is microtask

Microtask is the javascript code which needs to be executed immediately after the currently executing task/microtask is completed. They are kind of blocking in nature. i.e, The main thread will be blocked until the microtask queue is empty.
The main sources of microtasks are Promise.resolve, Promise.reject, MutationObservers, IntersectionObservers etc

**Note:** All of these microtasks are processed in the same turn of the event loop.
    

# What are different event loops

In JavaScript, there are multiple event loops that can be used depending on the context of your application. The most common event loops are:

1. The Browser Event Loop
2. The Node.js Event Loop

- Browser Event Loop: The Browser Event Loop is used in client-side JavaScript applications and is responsible for handling events that occur within the browser environment, such as user interactions (clicks, keypresses, etc.), HTTP requests, and other asynchronous actions.

- The Node.js Event Loop is used in server-side JavaScript applications and is responsible for handling events that occur within the Node.js runtime environment, such as file I/O, network I/O, and other asynchronous actions.

    

# What is the purpose of queueMicrotask
    
The `queueMicrotask` function is used to schedule a microtask, which is a function that will be executed asynchronously in the microtask queue. The purpose of `queueMicrotask` is to ensure that a function is executed after the current task has finished, but before the browser performs any rendering or handles user events.

Example:

```javascript
console.log('Start'); //1

queueMicrotask(() => {
  console.log('Inside microtask'); // 3
});

console.log('End'); //2
```
By using queueMicrotask, you can ensure that certain tasks or callbacks are executed at the earliest opportunity during the JavaScript event loop, making it useful for performing work that needs to be done asynchronously but with higher priority than regular `setTimeout` or `setInterval` callbacks.

    
# Promises VS Observable


| Promises                                                           | Observables                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Emits only a single value at a time                                | Emits multiple values over a period of time(stream of values ranging from 0 to multiple) |
| Eager in nature; they are going to be called immediately           | Lazy in nature; they require subscription to be invoked                                  |
| Promise is always asynchronous even though it resolved immediately | Observable can be either synchronous or asynchronous                                     |
| Doesn't provide any operators                                      | Provides operators such as map, forEach, filter, reduce, retry, and retryWhen etc        |
| Cannot be canceled                                                 | Canceled by using unsubscribe() method                                                   |


    

# What is an event table

Event Table is a data structure that stores and keeps track of all the events which will be executed asynchronously like after some time interval or after the resolution of some API requests. i.e Whenever you call a setTimeout function or invoke async operation, it is added to the Event Table.

It doesn't not execute functions on itâ€™s own. The main purpose of the event table is to keep track of events and send them to the Event Queue as shown in the below diagram.

    

# What is a microTask queue

Microtask Queue is the new queue where all the tasks initiated by promise objects get processed before the callback queue. The microtasks queue are processed before the next rendering and painting jobs. But if these microtasks are running for a long time then it leads to visual degradation.

    

# What is the difference between shim and polyfill

A shim is a library that brings a new API to an older environment, using only the means of that environment. It isn't necessarily restricted to a web application. For example, es5-shim.js is used to emulate ES5 features on older browsers (mainly pre IE9).
     
Whereas polyfill is a piece of code (or plugin) that provides the technology that you, the developer, expect the browser to provide natively.
     
In a simple sentence, A polyfill is a shim for a browser API.
    

# What is babel

Babel is a JavaScript transpiler to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. Some of the main features are listed below,

1. Transform syntax
2. Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment (using @babel/polyfill)
3. Source code transformations (or codemods)

    

# Is Node.js completely single threaded

Node is a single thread, but some of the functions included in the Node.js standard library(e.g, fs module functions) are not single threaded. i.e, Their logic runs outside of the Node.js single thread to improve the speed and performance of a program.

    

# What is the difference between Function constructor and function declaration

The functions which are created with `Function constructor` do not create closures to their creation contexts but they are always created in the global scope. i.e, the function can access its own local variables and global scope variables only. Whereas function declarations can access outer function variables(closures) too.



**Function Constructor:**

```javascript
var a = 100;
function createFunction() {
  var a = 200;
  return new Function("return a;");
}
console.log(createFunction()()); // 100
```

**Function declaration:**

```javascript
var a = 100;
function createFunction() {
  var a = 200;
  return function func() {
    return a;
  };
}
console.log(createFunction()()); // 200
```

    

# What is the easiest way to resize an array

The length property of an array is useful to resize or empty an array quickly. Let's apply length property on number array to resize the number of elements from 5 to 2,

```javascript
var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(array.length); // 5

array.length = 2;
console.log(array.length); // 2
console.log(array); // [1,2]
```

and the array can be emptied too

```javascript
var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
array.length = 0;
console.log(array.length); // 0
console.log(array); // []
```

    

# What is an async function

An async function is a function declared with the `async` keyword which enables asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style by avoiding promise chains. These functions can contain zero or more `await` expressions.

     

```javascript
async function logger() {
  let data = await fetch("http://someapi.com/users"); // pause until fetch returns
  console.log(data);
}
logger();
```

It is basically syntax sugar over ES2015 promises and generators.

    

# How do you prevent promises swallowing errors

While using asynchronous code, JavaScriptâ€™s ES6 promises can make your life a lot easier without having callback pyramids and error handling on every second line. But Promises have some pitfalls and the biggest one is swallowing errors by default.

Let's say you expect to print an error to the console for all the below cases,

```javascript
Promise.resolve("promised value").then(function () {
  throw new Error("error");
});

Promise.reject("error value").catch(function () {
  throw new Error("error");
});

new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  throw new Error("error");
});
```

But there are many modern JavaScript environments that won't print any errors. You can fix this problem in different ways,

1. **Add catch block at the end of each chain:** You can add catch block to the end of each of your promise chains

```javascript
Promise.resolve("promised value")
  .then(function () {
    throw new Error("error");
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    console.error(error.stack);
  });
```

But it is quite difficult to type for each promise chain and verbose too.

 2. **Add done method:** You can replace first solution's then and catch blocks with done method

```javascript
Promise.resolve("promised value").done(function () {
  throw new Error("error");
});
```

Let's say you want to fetch data using HTTP and later perform processing on the resulting data asynchronously. You can write `done` block as below,

```javascript
getDataFromHttp()
  .then(function (result) {
    return processDataAsync(result);
  })
  .done(function (processed) {
    displayData(processed);
  });
```

In future, if the processing library API changed to synchronous then you can remove `done` block as below,

```javascript
getDataFromHttp().then(function (result) {
  return displayData(processDataAsync(result));
});
```

and then you forgot to add `done` block to `then` block leads to silent errors.
    

# How do you check an object is a promise or not

If you don't know if a value is a promise or not, wrapping the value as `Promise.resolve(value)` which returns a promise

```javascript
function isPromise(object) {
  if (Promise && Promise.resolve) {
    return Promise.resolve(object) == object;
  } else {
    throw "Promise not supported in your environment";
  }
}

var i = 1;
var promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  resolve();
});

console.log(isPromise(i)); // false
console.log(isPromise(promise)); // true
```

Another way is to check for `.then()` handler type

```javascript
function isPromise(value) {
  return Boolean(value && typeof value.then === "function");
}
var i = 1;
var promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  resolve();
});

console.log(isPromise(i)); // false
console.log(isPromise(promise)); // true
```

    

# How to detect if a function is called as constructor

You can use `new.target` pseudo-property to detect whether a function was called as a constructor(using the new operator) or as a regular function call.

1. If a constructor or function invoked using the new operator, new.target returns a reference to the constructor or function.
2. For function calls, new.target is undefined.

```javascript
function Myfunc() {
   if (new.target) {
      console.log('called with new');
   } else {
      console.log('not called with new');
   }
}

new Myfunc(); // called with new
Myfunc(); // not called with new
Myfunc.call({}); // not called with new
```

    

# What are the differences between arguments object and rest parameter

There are three main differences between arguments object and rest parameters

1. The arguments object is an array-like but not an array. Whereas the rest parameters are array instances.
2. The arguments object does not support methods such as sort, map, forEach, or pop. Whereas these methods can be used in rest parameters.
3. The rest parameters are only the ones that havenâ€™t been given a separate name, while the arguments object contains all arguments passed to the function

    

# What are the differences between spread operator and rest parameter

Rest parameter collects all remaining elements into an array. Whereas Spread operator allows iterables( arrays / objects / strings ) to be expanded into single arguments/elements. i.e, Rest parameter is opposite to the spread operator.
