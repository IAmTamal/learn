//^ Question : https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/repeat-and-missing-number-array/

//^ Brute force approach
// Try to run through the whole array , if we find out the number which is missing by comparing with the index
// then we can find out the number which is repeated by comparing with the index. Needs to be sorted.

//^ Another approach
// another approach is to use a counter array to count the number of times a number is repeated.
// then we can find out the missing number and the repeated number.
