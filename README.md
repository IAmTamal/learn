## What even is this ?

**Whatever** you see here is what I THINK is essential, and I also wanted to document whatever I'm learning. There's gonna be alot of stuffs, it's quite less now, I'll keep adding whatever I learn! That's the only reason for this repo. My goal is to learn, not grind and rush through things.

**Slow and steady progress is still progress, as far as i am concerned.**
