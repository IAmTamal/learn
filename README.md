# What is this ?

Welcome to the hub of Tamal's resources. I generally like to document a lot of different questions that I find in the journey of learning to code. I have tried to keep track of the majority of the things in a markdown format so why not just convert it into `mdx` and make a website out of it for better accessibility.

The stuffs that are in:

 - Javascript
 - OOPS
 - React
 - LLD
 - CSS
 - Backend
