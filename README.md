# What is this ?

Welcome to the hub of Tamal's resources. I generally like to document a lot of different questions that I find in the journey of learning to code. This is a collection of most of those questions and answers (along with some other resources). I hope you find it useful.

## The stuffs that are in:

- Javascript
- OOPS
- React
- LLD
- CSS
- Backend


# What i learned from this ?

- Learned how to use markdown (mdx) and how to render that into any website for static contents instead of writing all those html tags.
- Revised some basics of tailwind css.
- Got a hub where I can track and keep all resources and just give a quick revision before an interview.
