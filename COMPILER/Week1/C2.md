## Write a C program to check if a user given C program statement is a valid Comment or not?

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int isComment(char *line, int n)
{
    if ((line[0] == '/' && line[1] == '/' && line[2] != '/') || (line[n - 2] == '*' && line[n - 1] == '/' && line[0] == '/' && line[1] == '*'))
        return 1;
    else
        return 0;
}
int main()
{
    char str[100];
    printf("Enter an identifier: ");
    scanf("%s", str);
    int n = strlen(str);
    if (isComment(str, n))
        printf("It is a comment\n");
    else
        printf("It is not a comment\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

This C program checks whether a given input string is a valid comment or not. 

The program takes an input string from the user using the `scanf` function and passes it to the `isComment` function to check if it is a comment or not. 

If it is a comment, the program prints "It is a comment," otherwise, it prints "It is not a comment."

**What is a comment ?**

A comment is a piece of code that is not executed by the compiler. It is used to explain the code and make it more readable.


The `isComment` function takes two arguments, a pointer to a character array line and an integer `n` which represents the length of the array. It checks if the input string line is a valid comment by checking the following conditions:

- If the first two characters of the input string are '//' and the third character is not '/', then it is a valid single-line comment.

- If the last two characters of the input string are '/' and the first two characters are '/', then it is a valid multi-line comment.

If any of the above conditions are true, the function returns 1, indicating that the input string is a valid comment. Otherwise, the function returns 0, indicating that it is not a valid comment.
