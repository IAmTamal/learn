# **Basics üçï**

## What do you mean by Asynchronous API? 

**Answer:**
All APIs of Node.js library are aynchronous that is non-blocking. It essentially means a Node.js based server never waits for a API to return data. Server moves to next API after calling it and a notification mechanism of Events of Node.js helps server to get response from the previous API call.

## What are the benefits of using Node.js? 

**Answer:**
Following are main benefits of using Node.js

*   **Aynchronous and Event Driven** - All APIs of Node.js library are aynchronous that is non-blocking. It essentially means a Node.js based server never waits for a API to return data. Server moves to next API after calling it and a notification mechanism of Events of Node.js helps server to get response from the previous API call.
*   **Very Fast** - Being built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, Node.js library is very fast in code execution.
*   **Single Threaded but highly Scalable** - Node.js uses a single threaded model with event looping. Event mechanism helps server to respond in a non-bloking ways and makes server highly scalable as opposed to traditional servers which create limited threads to handle requests. Node.js uses a single threaded program and same program can services much larger number of requests than traditional server like Apache HTTP Server.
*   **No Buffering** \- Node.js applications never buffer any data. These applications simply output the data in chunks.

## Is Node a single threaded application? 

**Answer:**
Yes! Node uses a single threaded model with event looping.

### If Node.js is single threaded then how it handles concurrency? 

**Answer:**
Node provides a single thread to programmers so that code can be written easily and without bottleneck. Node internally uses multiple POSIX threads for various I/O operations such as File, DNS, Network calls etc.

When Node gets I/O request it creates or uses a thread to perform that I/O operation and once the operation is done, it pushes the result to the event queue. On each such event, event loop runs and checks the queue and if the execution stack of Node is empty then it adds the queue result to execution stack.

This is how Node manages concurrency.


## What is global installation of dependencies? 

**Answer:**
Globally installed packages/dependencies are stored in **<user-directory>**/npm directory. Such dependencies can be used in CLI (Command Line Interface) function of any node.js but can not be imported using require() in Node application directly. To install a Node project globally use -g flag.


## What is an error-first callback? 

**Answer:**
*Error-first callbacks* are used to pass errors and data. The first argument is always an error object that the programmer has to check if something went wrong. Additional arguments are used to pass data.

```js
fs.readFile(filePath, function(err, data) {
  if (err) {
    //handle the error
  }
  // use the data object
});
```


## What's the difference between operational and programmer errors? 

**Answer:**
Operation errors are not bugs, but problems with the system, like _request timeout_ or _hardware failure_. On the other hand programmer errors are actual bugs.


## What is the difference between Nodejs, AJAX, and jQuery? 

**Answer:**
The one common trait between Node.js, AJAX, and jQuery is that all of them are the advanced implementation of JavaScript. However, they serve completely different purposes.

* Node.js ‚ÄìIt is a server-side platform for developing client-server applications. For example, if we‚Äôve to build an online employee management system, then we won‚Äôt do it using client-side JS. But the Node.js can certainly do it as it runs on a server similar to Apache, Django not in a browser.

* AJAX (aka Asynchronous Javascript and XML) ‚ÄìIt is a client-side scripting technique, primarily designed for rendering the contents of a page without refreshing it. There are a no. of large companies utilizing AJAX such as Facebook and Stack Overflow to display dynamic content.

* jQuery ‚ÄìIt is a famous JavaScript module which complements AJAX, DOM traversal, looping and so on. This library provides many useful functions to help in JavaScript development. However, it‚Äôs not mandatory to use it but as it also manages cross-browser compatibility, so can help you produce highly maintainable web applications.


## How to make Post request in Node.js? 

**Answer:**
Following code snippet can be used to make a Post Request in Node.js.

```js
var request = require('request');
request.post('http://www.example.com/action', {
  form: {
    key: 'value'
  }
}, function(error, response, body) {
  if (!error && response.statusCode == 200) {
    console.log(body)
  }
});
```


## What are the key features of Node.js? 

**Answer:**
Let‚Äôs look at some of the key features of Node.js.

*   **Asynchronous event driven IO helps concurrent request handling ‚Äì** All APIs of Node.js are asynchronous. This feature means that if a Node receives a request for some Input/Output operation, it will execute that operation in the background and continue with the¬†processing of other requests. Thus it will not wait for the response from the previous requests.
*   **Fast in Code execution ‚Äì** Node.js uses the V8 JavaScript Runtime engine, the one which is used by Google Chrome. Node has a wrapper over the JavaScript engine which makes the runtime engine much faster and hence processing of requests within Node.js also become faster.
*   **Single Threaded but Highly Scalable ‚Äì** Node.js uses a single thread model for event looping. The response from these events may or may not reach the server immediately. However, this does not block other operations. Thus making Node.js highly scalable. Traditional servers create limited threads to handle requests while Node.js creates a single thread that provides service to much larger numbers of such requests.
*   **Node.js library uses JavaScript ‚Äì** This is another important aspect of Node.js from the developer‚Äôs point of view. The majority of developers are already well-versed in JavaScript. Hence, development in Node.js becomes easier for a developer who knows JavaScript.
*   **There is an Active and vibrant community for the Node.js framework ‚Äì** The active community always keeps the framework updated with the latest trends in the web development.
*   **No Buffering ‚Äì** Node.js applications never buffer any data. They simply output the data in chunks.


## What is control flow function?   

**Answer:**
It is a generic piece of code which runs in between several asynchronous function calls is known as control flow function.

# **Callbacks & Events üéâ**

## What is Callback? 

**Answer:**
**Callback** is an asynchronous equivalent for a function. A callback function is called at the completion of a given task. Node makes heavy use of callbacks. All APIs of Node are written is such a way that they supports callbacks. 

For example, a function to read a file may start reading file and return the control to execution environment immediately so that next instruction can be executed. Once file I/O is complete, it will call the callback function while passing the callback function, the content of the file as parameter. So there is no blocking or wait for File I/O. 

This makes Node.js highly scalable, as it can process high number of request without waiting for any function to return result.

### What is Callback Hell? 

**Answer:**
The asynchronous function requires callbacks as a return parameter. When multiple asynchronous functions are chained together then callback hell situation comes up. 

### What is the difference between returning a callback and just calling a callback? 

**Answer:**
```js
return callback();
//some more lines of code; -  won't be executed

callback();
//some more lines of code; - will be executed
```

Of course returning will help the context calling async function get the value returned by callback.

```js
function do2(callback) {
    log.trace('Execute function: do2');
    return callback('do2 callback param');
}

var do2Result = do2((param) => {
    log.trace(`print ${param}`);
    return `return from callback(${param})`; // we could use that return
});

log.trace(`print ${do2Result}`);
```
Output:
```sh
C:\Work\Node>node --use-strict main.js
[0] Execute function: do2
[0] print do2 callback param
[0] print return from callback(do2 callback param)
```


### How to avoid callback hell in Node.js? 

**Answer:**
Node.js internally uses a single-threaded event loop to process queued events. But this approach may lead to blocking the entire process if there is a task running longer than expected.

Node.js addresses this problem by incorporating callbacks also known as higher-order functions. So whenever a long-running process finishes its execution, it triggers the callback associated. 

sometimes, it could lead to complex and unreadable code. More the no. of callbacks, longer the chain of returning callbacks would be.

There are four solutions which can address the callback hell problem.

**Make your program modular**

It proposes to split the logic into smaller modules. And then join them together from the main module to achieve the desired result.

**Use async mechanism**

It is a widely used Node.js module which provides a sequential flow of execution.

The async module has <async.waterfall> API which passes data from one operation to other using the next callback.

Another async API <async.map> allows iterating over a list of items in parallel and calls back with another list of results.

With the async approach, the caller‚Äôs callback gets called only once. The caller here is the main method using the async module.

**Use promises mechanism**

Promises give an alternate way to write async code. They either return the result of execution or the error/exception. Implementing promises requires the use of <.then()> function which waits for the promise object to return. It takes two optional arguments, both functions. Depending on the state of the promise only one of them will get called. The first function call proceeds if the promise gets fulfilled. However, if the promise gets rejected, then the second function will get called.

**Use generators**

Generators are lightweight routines, they make a function wait and resume via the yield keyword. Generator functions uses a special syntax <function* ()>. They can also suspend and resume asynchronous operations using constructs such as promises or <thunks> and turn a synchronous code into asynchronous.


### How do you convert an existing callback API to promises? 

**Details:**
How to convert this callback code to Promise? Provide some examples.
```js
function divisionAPI (number, divider, successCallback, errorCallback) {
    if (divider == 0) {
        return errorCallback( new Error("Division by zero") )
    }
    successCallback( number / divider )
}
```

**Answer:**
```js
function divisionAPI(number, divider) {
    return new Promise(function(fulfilled, rejected) {
        if (divider == 0) {
            return rejected(new Error("Division by zero"))
        }
        fulfilled(number / divider)
    })
}

// Promise can be used with together async\await in ES7 to make the program flow wait for a fullfiled result
async function foo() {
    var result = await divisionAPI(1, 2); // awaits for a fulfilled result!
    console.log(result);
}

// Another usage with the same code by using .then() method
divisionAPI(1, 2).then(function(result) {
    console.log(result)
})
```
Node.js 8.0.0 includes a new `util.promisify()` API that allows standard Node.js callback style APIs to be wrapped in a function that returns a Promise. 

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const util = require('util');

const readfile = util.promisify(fs.readFile);

readfile('/some/file')
    .then((data) => {
        /** ... **/ 
     })
    .catch((err) => {
        /** ... **/ 
    });
```



### What are async functions in Node? Provide some examples. 

**Answer:**
With the release of Node.js 8, the long awaited async functions have landed in Node.js as well. ES 2017 introduced Asynchronous functions. Async functions are essentially a cleaner way to work with asynchronous code in JavaScript.

Async/Await is:
* The newest way to write asynchronous code in JavaScript.
* It is non blocking (just like promises and callbacks).
* Async/Await was created to simplify the process of working with and writing chained promises.
* Async functions return a Promise. If the function throws an error, the Promise will be rejected. If the function returns a value, the Promise will be resolved.

**Async functions** can make use of the `await` expression. This will pause the async function and wait for the _Promise_ to resolve prior to moving on.

### Rewrite promise-based Node.js applications to Async/Await 

**Details:**
Rewrite this code to Async/Await:
```js
function asyncTask() {
    return functionA()
        .then((valueA) => functionB(valueA))
        .then((valueB) => functionC(valueB))
        .then((valueC) => functionD(valueC))
        .catch((err) => logger.error(err))
}
```


**Answer:**
```js
async function asyncTask() {
    try {
        const valueA = await functionA()
        const valueB = await functionB(valueA)
        const valueC = await functionC(valueB)
        return await functionD(valueC)
    } catch (err) {
        logger.error(err)
    }
}
```

### How would you handle errors for async code in Node.js? 

**Answer:**
Handling async errors in callback style (error-first approach) is probably the fastest way to hell (a.k.a the pyramid of doom). It's better to use a reputable promise library or async-await instead which enables a much more compact and familiar code syntax like try-catch.

Consider promises to catch errors:
```js
doWork()
 .then(doWork)
 .then(doOtherWork)
 .then((result) => doWork)
 .catch((error) => {throw error;})
 .then(verify);
```
or using async/await:
```js
async function check(req, res) {
    try {
        const a = await someOtherFunction();
        const b = await somethingElseFunction();
        res.send("result")
    } catch (error) {
        res.send(error.stack);
    }
}
```

### What is difference between promises and async-await in Node.js?

**1. Promises:**

A promise is used to handle the asynchronous result of an operation. JavaScript is designed to not wait for an asynchronous block of code to completely execute before other synchronous parts of the code can run. With Promises, we can defer the execution of a code block until an async request is completed. This way, other operations can keep running without interruption.

**States of Promises:**

* `Pending`: Initial State, before the Promise succeeds or fails.
* `Resolved`: Completed Promise
* `Rejected`: Failed Promise, throw an error

**Example:**

```js
function logFetch(url) {
  return fetch(url)
    .then(response => {
      console.log(response);
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.error('fetch failed', err);
    });
}
```

**2. Async-Await:**

`Await` is basically syntactic sugar for **Promises**. It makes asynchronous code look more like synchronous/procedural code, which is easier for humans to understand.

Putting the keyword `async` before a function tells the function to return a Promise. If the code returns something that is not a `Promise`, then JavaScript automatically wraps it into a resolved promise with that value. The `await` keyword simply makes JavaScript wait until that `Promise` settles and then returns its result.

**Example:**

```js
async function logFetch(url) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    console.log(response);
  }
  catch (err) {
    console.log('fetch failed', err);
  }
}
```

### Mention the steps by which you can async in Node.js?

ES 2017 introduced Asynchronous functions. Async functions are essentially a cleaner way to work with asynchronous code in JavaScript. 

**1. Async/Await:**

* The newest way to write asynchronous code in JavaScript.
* It is non blocking (just like promises and callbacks).
* Async/Await was created to simplify the process of working with and writing chained promises.
* Async functions return a Promise. If the function throws an error, the Promise will be rejected. If the function returns a value, the Promise will be resolved.  

Syntax

```js
// Normal Function
function add(x,y){
  return x + y;
}
// Async Function
async function add(x,y){
  return x + y;
}
```

**2. Await:**

Async functions can make use of the await expression. This will pause the async function and wait for the Promise to resolve prior to moving on.  

**Example:**

```js
function doubleAfter2Seconds(x) {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve(x * 2);
    }, 2000);
  });
}

async function addAsync(x) {
  const a = await doubleAfter2Seconds(10);
  const b = await doubleAfter2Seconds(20);
  const c = await doubleAfter2Seconds(30);
  return x + a + b + c;
}


addAsync(10).then((sum) => {
  console.log(sum);
});
```

## What is a blocking code? 

**Answer:**
If application has to wait for some I/O operation in order to complete its execution any further then the code responsible for waiting is known as blocking code.

## Difference between Asynchronous and Non-blocking?

**1. Asynchronous:**

The architecture of asynchronous explains that the message sent will not give the reply on immediate basis just like we send the mail but do not get the reply on an immediate basis. It does not have any dependency or order. Hence improving the system efficiency and performance. The server stores the information and when the action is done it will be notified.

**2. Non-Blocking:**

Nonblocking immediately responses with whatever data available. Moreover, it does not block any execution and keeps on running as per the requests. If an answer could not be retrieved then in those cases API returns immediately with an error. Nonblocking is mostly used with I/O(input/output). Node.js is itself based on nonblocking I/O model. There are few ways of communication that a nonblocking I/O has completed. The callback function is to be called when the operation is completed. Nonblocking call uses the help of javascript which provides a callback function.


## How node.js prevents blocking code?

**Blocking vs Non-blocking:**

**Blocking** is when the execution of additional JavaScript in the Node.js process must wait until a non-JavaScript operation completes. This happens because the event loop is unable to continue running JavaScript while a **blocking** operation is occurring.

Synchronous methods in the Node.js standard library that use **libuv** are the most commonly used blocking operations. Native modules may also have blocking methods. Blocking methods execute `synchronously` and non-blocking methods execute `asynchronously`.

**Example:**

```js
// Blocking
const fs = require('fs');
const data = fs.readFileSync('/file.md'); // blocks here until file is read
console.log(data);
moreWork(); // will run after console.log

// Non-blocking
const fs = require('fs');
fs.readFile('/file.md', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data);
});
moreWork(); // will run before console.log
```

## What's the event loop? 

**Answer:**
**The event loop** is what allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations ‚Äî despite the fact that JavaScript is single-threaded ‚Äî by offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible.

<div class="text-center">
<img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Lbs9z.png" class="img-fluid">


Every I/O requires a callback - once they are done they are pushed onto the event loop for execution. Since most modern kernels are multi-threaded, they can handle multiple operations executing in the background. When one of these operations completes, the kernel tells Node.js so that the appropriate callback may be added to the poll queue to eventually be executed.

### What are Event Listeners in NodeJS?   

**Answer:**
**Event Listeners** are similar to call back functions but are associated with some event. For example when a server listens to http request on a given port a event will be generated and to specify http server has received and will invoke corresponding event listener. Basically, Event listener's are also call backs for a corresponding event.

Node.js has built in event's and built in event listeners. Node.js also provides functionality to create Custom events and Custom Event listeners.


### What is Event Emmitter? 

**Answer:**
All objects that emit events are members of EventEmitter class. These objects expose an `eventEmitter.on()` function that allows one or more functions to be attached to named events emitted by the object.

When the EventEmitter object emits an event, all of the functions attached to that specific event are called synchronously. 

```js
const EventEmitter = require('events');

class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {}

const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();
myEmitter.on('event', () => {
  console.log('an event occurred!');
});
myEmitter.emit('event');
```

### When should I use EventEmitter? 

**Answer:**
Whenever it makes sense for code to *subscribe* to something rather than get a callback from something. The typical use case would be that there's multiple blocks of code in your application that may need to do something when an event happens.


# **Engine üöÇüëáüèª**

## What is V8? 

**Answer:**
The V8 library provides Node.js with a JavaScript engine (a program that converts Javascript code into lower level or machine code that microprocessors can understand), which Node.js controls via the V8 C++ API. V8 is maintained by Google, for use in Chrome.

The Chrome V8 engine :

* The V8 engine is written in C++ and used in Chrome and Nodejs.
* It implements ECMAScript as specified in ECMA-262.
* The V8 engine can run standalone we can embed it with our own C++ program.

## Can Node.js work without V8? 

**Answer:**
No. The current node.js binary cannot work without V8. It would have no Javascript engine and thus no ability to run code which would obviously render it non-functional. Node.js was not designed to run with any other Javascript engine and, in fact, all the native code bindings that come with node.js (such as the fs module or the net module) all rely on the specific V8 interface between C++ and Javascript.

There is an effort by Microsoft to allow the Chakra Javascript engine (that's the engine in Edge) to be used with node.js. Node.js can actually function to some extent without V8, through use of the node-chakracore project. There is ongoing work to reduce the tight coupling between V8 and Node, so that different JavaScript engines can be used in-place.



## How the V8 engine works? 

**Answer:**
**V8** is a JavaScript engine built at the google development center, in Germany. It is open source and written in C++. It is used for both client side (Google Chrome) and server side (node.js) JavaScript applications.

V8 was first designed to increase the performance of the JavaScript execution inside web browsers. In order to obtain speed, V8 translates JavaScript code into more efficient machine code instead of using an interpreter. It compiles JavaScript code into machine code at execution by implementing a **JIT (Just-In-Time)** compiler like a lot of modern JavaScript engines such as SpiderMonkey or Rhino (Mozilla) are doing. The main difference with V8 is that it doesn‚Äôt produce bytecode or any intermediate code.


## What is the purpose of using hidden classes in V8? 

**Answer:**
JavaScript is a prototype-based language: there are no classes and objects are created by using a cloning process. JavaScript is also dynamically typed: types and type informations are not explicit and properties can be added to and deleted from objects on the fly. 

Accessing types and properties effectively makes a first big challenge for V8. Instead of using a dictionary-like data structure for storing object properties and doing a dynamic lookup to resolve the property location (like most JavaScript engines do), V8 creates** hidden classes**, at runtime, in order to have an internal representation of the type system and to improve the property access time.


## How V8 compiles JavaScript code? 

**Answer:**
V8 has two compilers:

* A **‚ÄúFull‚Äù Compiler** that can generate good code for any JavaScript: good but not great JIT code. The goal of this compiler is to generate code quickly. To achieve its goal, it doesn‚Äôt do any type analysis and doesn‚Äôt know anything about types. Instead, it uses an Inline Caches or ‚ÄúIC‚Äù strategy to refine knowledge about types while the program runs. IC is very efficient and brings about 20 times speed improvment.

* An **Optimizing Compiler** that produces great code for most of the JavaScript language. It comes later and re-compiles hot functions. The optimizing compiler takes types from the Inline Cache and make decisions about how to optimize the code better. However, some language features are not supported yet like try/catch blocks for instance. (The workaround for try/catch blocks is to write the ‚Äúnon stable‚Äù code in a function and call the function in the try block)

V8 also supports **de-optimization**: the optimizing compiler makes optimistic assumptions from the Inline Cache about the different types, de-optimization comes if these assumptions are invalid. For example, if a hidden class generated was not the one expected, V8 throws away the optimized code and comes back to the Full Compiler to get types again from the Inline Cache. This process is slow and should be avoided by trying to not change functions after they are optimized.


## Can Node.js use other engines than V8? 

**Answer:**
Yes. Microsoft Chakra is another JavaScript engine which can be used with Node.js. It‚Äôs not officially declared yet.

## Explain RESTful Web Services in Node.js?

REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. REST is web standards based architecture and uses HTTP Protocol.
It is an architectural style as well as an approach for communications purposes that is often used in various web services development. A REST Server simply provides access to resources and REST client accesses and modifies the resources using HTTP protocol.

**HTTP methods:**

* `GET` ‚àí Provides read-only access to a resource.
* `PUT` ‚àí Updates an existing resource or creates a new resource.
* `DELETE` ‚àí Removes a resource.
* `POST` ‚àí Creates a new resource.
* `PATCH`‚àí Update/modify a resource

**Example:**

```json
// users.json
{
   "user1" : {
      "id": 1,
      "name" : "Ehsan Philip",
      "age" : 24
   },

   "user2" : {
      "id": 2,
      "name" : "Karim Jimenez",
      "age" : 22
   },

   "user3" : {
      "id": 3,
      "name" : "Giacomo Weir",
      "age" : 18
   }
}
```

**List Users** ( `GET` method)

Let\'s implement our first RESTful API listUsers using the following code in a server.js file ‚àí

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const fs = require("fs");

app.get('/listUsers', function (req, res) {
   fs.readFile( __dirname + "/" + "users.json", 'utf8', function (err, data) {
      console.log( data );
      res.end( data );
   });
})

const server = app.listen(3000, function () {
   const host = server.address().address
   const port = server.address().port
   console.log("App listening at http://%s:%s", host, port)
});
```

**Add User** ( `POST` method )

Following API will show you how to add new user in the list. 

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const fs = require("fs");

const user = {
   "user4" : {
      "id": 4,
      "name" : "Spencer Amos",
      "age" : 28
   }
}

app.post('/addUser', function (req, res) {
   // First read existing users.
   fs.readFile( __dirname + "/" + "users.json", 'utf8', function (err, data) {
      data = JSON.parse( data );
      data["user4"] = user["user4"];
      console.log( data );
      res.end( JSON.stringify(data));
   });
})

const server = app.listen(3000, function () {
   const host = server.address().address
   const port = server.address().port
   console.log("App listening at http://%s:%s", host, port)
})
```

**Delete User:**

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const fs = require("fs");

const id = 2;

app.delete('/deleteUser', function (req, res) {
   // First read existing users.
   fs.readFile( __dirname + "/" + "users.json", 'utf8', function (err, data) {
      data = JSON.parse( data );
      delete data["user" + 2];
      console.log( data );
      res.end( JSON.stringify(data));
   });
})

const server = app.listen(3000, function () {
   const host = server.address().address
   const port = server.address().port
   console.log("App listening at http://%s:%s", host, port)
})
```


    


## What is the difference between `reparams` and `requery` ?

The **reparams** are a part of a path in URL and they\'re also known as URL variables. for example, if you have the route **/books/:id**, then the **id** property will be available as **reparams.id**. reparams default value is an empty object {}.

A **requery** is a part of a URL that assigns values to specified parameters. A query string commonly includes fields added to a base URL by a Web browser or other client application, for example as part of an HTML form. A query is the last part of URL

**Example 01:** reparams

```js
/**
 * reparams
 */

// GET  http://localhost:3000/employees/10

app.get('/employees/:id', (req, res, next) => {
   console.log(reparams.id); // 10
})
```

**Example 02:** requery

```js
/**
 * requery
 */

// GET  http://localhost:3000/employees?page=20

app.get('/employees', (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(requery.page) // 20
})
```


    


##  How to make post request in Node.js?

Following code snippet can be used to make a Post Request in Node.js.

```js
/**
 * POST Request
 */
const request = require("request");

request.post("http://localhost:3000/action",  { form: { key: "value" } },
  function (error, response, body) {
    if (!error && response.statusCode === 200) {
      console.log(body);
    }
  }
);
```


    


## What are Promises in Node.js?

It allows to associate handlers to an asynchronous action\'s eventual success value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise for the value at some point in the future.

Promises in node.js promised to do some work and then had separate callbacks that would be executed for success and failure as well as handling timeouts. Another way to think of promises in node.js was that they were emitters that could emit only two events: success and error.The cool thing about promises is you can combine them into dependency chains (do Promise C only when Promise A and Promise B complete).

The core idea behind promises is that a promise represents the result of an asynchronous operation. A promise is in one of three different states:

* pending - The initial state of a promise.
* fulfilled - The state of a promise representing a successful operation.
* rejected - The state of a promise representing a failed operation.
Once a promise is fulfilled or rejected, it is immutable (i.e. it can never change again).  

**Creating a Promise:**

```js
const myPromise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
   ....
})
```


    


## How can you secure your HTTP cookies against XSS attacks?

**1.** When the web server sets cookies, it can provide some additional attributes to make sure the cookies won\'t be accessible by using malicious JavaScript. One such attribute is HttpOnly. HttpOnly makes sure the cookies will be submitted only to the domain they originated from.

**2.** The "Secure" attribute can make sure the cookies are sent over secured channel only.

**3.** The web server can use X-XSS-Protection response header to make sure pages do not load when they detect reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

**4.** The web server can use HTTP Content-Security-Policy response header to control what resources a user agent is allowed to load for a certain page. It can help to prevent various types of attacks like Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.


##  How to make an HTTP POST request using Node.js?

```js
const https = require('https')


const obj = {
    "userId":1,
    "id":1,
    "title":"whatever",
    "completed":false
}

const data = JSON.stringify(obj)

const options = {
  hostname: 'jsonplaceholder.typicode.com',
  port: 443,
  path: '/todos',
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Content-Length': data.length
  }
}

const req = https.request(options, res => {
  console.log(`statusCode: ${res.statusCode}`)

  res.on('data', d => {
    process.stdout.write(d)
  })
})

reon('error', error => {
  console.error(error)
})

rewrite(data)
reend()
```


##  Name the types of API functions in Node.js?

There are two types of API functions in Node.js:

* Asynchronous, Non-blocking functions
* Synchronous, Blocking functions

**1. Blocking functions:**

In a blocking operation, all other code is blocked from executing until an I/O event that is being waited on occurs. Blocking functions execute synchronously.

**Example:**

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const data = fs.readFileSync('/file.md'); // blocks here until file is read
console.log(data);
// moreWork(); will run after console.log
```

The second line of code blocks the execution of additional JavaScript until the entire file is read. moreWork () will only be called after Console.log

**2. Non-blocking functions:**

In a non-blocking operation, multiple I/O calls can be performed without the execution of the program being halted. Non-blocking functions execute asynchronously.

**Example:**

```js
const fs = require('fs');
fs.readFile('/file.md', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data);
});
// moreWork(); will run before console.log
```

Since `fs.readFile()` is non-blocking, moreWork() does not have to wait for the file read to complete before being called. This allows for higher throughput.


    


##  What is difference between put and patch?

PUT and PATCH are HTTP verbs and they both relate to updating a resource. The main difference between PUT and PATCH requests are in the way the server processes the enclosed entity to modify the resource identified by the Request-URI.

In a PUT request, the enclosed entity is considered to be a modified version of the resource stored on the origin server, and the client is requesting that the stored version be replaced.

With PATCH, however, the enclosed entity contains a set of instructions describing how a resource currently residing on the origin server should be modified to produce a new version.

Also, another difference is that when you want to update a resource with PUT request, you have to send the full payload as the request whereas with PATCH, you only send the parameters which you want to update.

The most commonly used HTTP verbs POST, GET, PUT, DELETE are similar to CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations in database. We specify these HTTP verbs in the capital case. So, the below is the comparison between them.

* `POST` - create
* `GET`  - read  
* `PUT`  - update
* `DELETE` - delete

**PATCH**: Submits a partial modification to a resource. If you only need to update one field for the resource, you may want to use the PATCH method.


    


##  List types of Http requests supported by Node.js?

```js
const http = require('http')

**Making HTTP Requests**

```js
const request = require('request');

request('https://nodejs.org/', function(err, res, body) {
    console.log(body);
});
```

The first argument to request can either be a URL string, or an object of options. Here are some of the more common options you\'ll encounter in your applications:

* **url**: The destination URL of the HTTP request
* **method**: The HTTP method to be used (GET, POST, DELETE, etc)
* **headers**: An object of HTTP headers (key-value) to be set in the request
* **form**: An object containing key-value form data

```js
const request = require('request');

const options = {
    url: 'https://nodejs.org/file.json',
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
        'Accept': 'application/json',
        'Accept-Charset': 'utf-8',
        'User-Agent': 'my-reddit-client'
    }
};

request(options, function(err, res, body) {
    let json = JSON.parse(body);
    console.log(json);
});
```

Using the options object, this request uses the GET method to retrieve JSON data directly from Reddit, which is returned as a string in the body field. From here, you can use `JSON.parse` and use the data as a normal JavaScript object.


##  How to use Q promise in Node.js?

A promise is an object that represents the return value or the thrown exception that the function may eventually provide. A promise can also be used as a proxy for a remote object to overcome latency.

Promise is relatively an easy implementation for asynchronous operation. The promise object returned from the function represents an operation which is not completed yet, but it guarantees to the caller of the operation that the operation will be completed in future.

Promise has the following states:

* **Pending** - asynchronous operation is not yet completed.
* **Fulfilled** - asynchronous operation is completed successfully.
* **Rejected** - asynchronous operation is terminated with an error.
* **Settled** - asynchronous operation is either fulfilled or rejected.
* **Callback** - function is executed if the promise is executed with value.
* **Errback** - function is executed if the promise is rejected.

**Moving to Promises from Callback**

On the first pass, promises can mitigate the **Pyramid of Doom**: the situation where code marches to the right faster than it marches forward.

```js
step1(function (value1) {
    step2(value1, function(value2) {
        step3(value2, function(value3) {
            step4(value3, function(value4) {
                // Do something with value4
            });
        });
    });
});
```

With a promise library, it can flatten the pyramid.

```js
fcall(promisedStep1)
.then(promisedStep2)
.then(promisedStep3)
.then(promisedStep4)
.then(function (value4) {
    // Do something with value4
})
.catch(function (error) {
    // Handle any error from all above steps
})
.done();
```

## # 12. NODE.JS ROUTING

<br/>

##  How does routing work in Node.js?

Routing defines the way in which the client requests are handled by the application endpoints. We define routing using methods of the Express app object that correspond to HTTP methods; for example, `app.get()` to handle `GET` requests and `app.post` to handle `POST` requests, `app.all()` to handle all HTTP methods and `app.use()` to specify middleware as the callback function.

These routing methods "listens" for requests that match the specified route(s) and method(s), and when it detects a match, it calls the specified callback function.

*Syntax*:

```js
app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)
```

Where:

* app is an instance of express.
* METHOD is an `HTTP request method`.
* PATH is a path on the server.
* HANDLER is the function executed when the route is matched.

**a) Route methods:**

```js
// GET method route
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('GET request')
})

// POST method route
app.post('/login', function (req, res) {
  res.send('POST request')
})

// ALL method route
app.all('/secret', function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('Accessing the secret section ...')
  next() // pass control to the next handler
})
```

**b) Route paths:**

Route paths, in combination with a request method, define the endpoints at which requests can be made. Route paths can be strings, string patterns, or regular expressions.

The characters `?`, `+`, `*`, and `()` are subsets of their regular expression counterparts. The hyphen `(-)` and the dot `(.)` are interpreted literally by string-based paths.

**Example:**

```js
// This route path will match requests to /about.
app.get('/about', function (req, res) {
  res.send('about')
})


// This route path will match acd and abcd.
app.get('/ab?cd', function (req, res) {
  res.send('ab?cd')
})


// This route path will match butterfly and dragonfly
app.get(/.*fly$/, function (req, res) {
  res.send('/.*fly$/')
})
```

**c) Route parameters:**

Route parameters are named URL segments that are used to capture the values specified at their position in the URL. The captured values are populated in the `reparams` object, with the name of the route parameter specified in the path as their respective keys.

**Example:**

```js
app.get('/users/:userId', function (req, res) {
  res.send(reparams)
})
```

**Response methods:**

| Method             | Description                                                                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `res.download()`   | Prompt a file to be downloaded.                                                       |
| `res.end()`        | End the response process.                                                             |
| `res.json()`       | Send a JSON response.                                                                 |
| `res.jsonp()`      | Send a JSON response with JSONP support.                                              |
| `res.redirect()`   | Redirect a request.                                                                   |
| `res.render()`     | Render a view template.                                                               |
| `res.send()`       | Send a response of various types.                                                     |
| `res.sendFile()`   | Send a file as an octet stream.                                                       |
| `res.sendStatus()` | Set the response status code and send its string representation as the response body. |

**d) Router method:**

```js
const express = require('express')
const router = express.Router()

// middleware that is specific to this router
router.use(function timeLog (req, res, next) {
  console.log('Time: ', Date.now())
  next()
})

// define the home page route
router.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Birds home page')
})

// define the about route
router.get('/about', function (req, res) {
  res.send('About birds')
})

module.exports = router
```
