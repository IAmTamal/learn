# Types

Almost everything in golang is a type.  for example we have String, Bool, Integer, Floating, Complex. Also Array, slices, Maps, Structs, Pointers, Functions, Interfaces, Channels.


# Variables

Variables are declared using the var keyword.  Variables can be declared at the package or function level.  Variables declared without an explicit initial value are given their default value. 

```go
var username string = "admin"

fmt.Println(username)
fmt.Println("The variable is of type: ", fmt.Sprintf("%T", username))


var isVerified bool = true

fmt.Println(isVerified)
fmt.Println("The variable is of type: ", fmt.Sprintf("%T", isVerified))

// ANSWER: The variable is of type:  string
// ANSWER: The variable is of type:  bool
```

## Different integers types

We have the following integer types:

- uint8: unsigned  8-bit integers (0 to 255)
- uint16: unsigned 16-bit integers (0 to 65535)
- uint32: unsigned 32-bit integers (0 to 4294967295)


If i try to assign a value that is out of range, i will get an error.

```go

var smallInt uint8 = 255 
fmt.Println("We can just have upto 255 in uint8, anything bigger will give an error: ", smallInt)



var smallFloat float32 = 200000.5294729347298472984792475
fmt.Println("This float32 will just be rounded off to: ", smallFloat)



var bigFLoat float64 = 200000.5294729347298472984792475
fmt.Println("This float64 will just be rounded off to: ", bigFLoat)
```


## Default Values


If you declare a variable without giving it an explicit initial value, the variable is given the zero value for its type.

The default value is `0` for numeric types, `false` for the boolean type, and " " for strings.

```go
var a int
fmt.Println(a)
fmt.Println("The variable is of type: ", fmt.Sprintf("%T", a))
```


# Implicit type declaration

You can also 

export default ({children}) => <div className="prose md">{children}</div>
