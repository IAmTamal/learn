# How do you compare Object and Map

**Objects** are similar to **Maps** in that both let you set keys to values, retrieve those values, delete keys, and detect whether something is stored at a key. Due to this reason, Objects have been used as Maps historically. But there are important differences that make using a Map preferable in certain cases.

1. The keys of an Object are Strings and Symbols, whereas they can be any value for a Map, including functions, objects, and any primitive.
2. The keys in Map are ordered while keys added to Object are not. Thus, when iterating over it, a Map object returns keys in order of insertion.
3. You can get the size of a Map easily with the size property, while the number of properties in an Object must be determined manually.
4. A Map is an iterable and can thus be directly iterated, whereas iterating over an Object requires obtaining its keys in some fashion iterating over them.
5. An Object has a prototype, so there are default keys in the map that could collide with your keys if you're not careful. As of ES5 this can bypassed by using map = Object.create(null), but this is seldom done.
6. A Map may perform better in scenarios involving frequent addition and removal of key pairs.

# What is the difference between == and === operators

JavaScript provides both strict(===, !==) and type-converting(==, !=) equality comparison. The strict operators take type of variable in consideration, while non-strict operators make type correction/conversion based upon values of variables. The strict operators follow the below conditions for different types,

1. Two strings are strictly equal when they have the same sequence of characters, same length, and same characters in corresponding positions.
2. Two numbers are strictly equal when they are numerically equal. i.e, Having the same number value.
      There are two special cases in this,
1. NaN is not equal to anything, including NaN.
2. Positive and negative zeros are equal to one another.
3. Two Boolean operands are strictly equal if both are true or both are false.


Some of the example which covers the above cases,

```javascript
0 == false   // true
0 === false  // false
1 == "1"     // true
1 === "1"    // false
null == undefined // true
null === undefined // false
'0' == false // true
'0' === false // false
[]==[] or []===[] //false, refer different objects in memory
{}=={} or {}==={} //false, refer different objects in memory
```


# What is a service worker

A Service worker is basically a script (JavaScript file) that runs in the background, separate from a web page and provides features that don't need a web page or user interaction. Some of the major features of service workers are Rich offline experiences(offline first web application development), periodic background syncs, push notifications, intercept and handle network requests and programmatically managing a cache of responses.

   
# DOM/HTML Related üëáüèª

## Why do you think React is faster than HTML/JS ? 


React is often perceived as faster than traditional HTML/JS approaches due to several key reasons:

- Virtual DOM: React employs a Virtual DOM (Document Object Model), which is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. When there are changes to the state or data, React calculates the minimal changes required in the Virtual DOM and efficiently updates the real DOM. This reduces the number of actual DOM manipulations, resulting in improved performance.

- Efficient Reconciliation: React's reconciliation process ensures that only the necessary components are updated when data changes occur. This smart diffing algorithm helps avoid unnecessary re-renders of unchanged components, optimizing the rendering process.

- Component-based Architecture: React's component-based architecture promotes modularity and reusability. Components encapsulate their logic and rendering, enabling faster development and better code organization. This modular approach allows for easier optimization of specific components without affecting the entire application.

- One-Way Data Flow: React follows a one-way data flow, meaning data flows unidirectionally from parent components to child components. This predictable data flow helps in understanding how data changes propagate, reducing bugs and making the application easier to reason about.

- Virtual DOM Batch Updates: React batches multiple updates to the Virtual DOM and performs them in a single batch. This reduces the number of renders and updates to the actual DOM, enhancing performance.

- React Fiber: React introduced Fiber, a reimplementation of its core algorithm, to improve its ability to pause, abort, or resume rendering as needed. Fiber's asynchronous rendering capabilities allow React to prioritize more important tasks, leading to smoother user experiences.

- Performance Tools: React provides developers with powerful performance tools like React DevTools and Profiler. These tools enable developers to analyze the application's performance, identify bottlenecks, and make targeted optimizations.

- Community and Ecosystem: React's popularity has led to a vast community and ecosystem of third-party libraries and tools. Many of these are built with performance in mind, helping developers create faster and more efficient applications.

While React provides excellent performance out of the box, it's crucial to note that performance can still be affected by how developers write their code. Properly optimizing components, avoiding unnecessary re-renders, and using performance best practices will contribute to even faster React applications.

## Any case where this is not true ?

Yes, there are specific scenarios where traditional HTML/JS can be faster or more appropriate than using React:

- Simple Static Websites: For simple static websites with limited interactivity and static content, using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without the overhead of a framework like React can be more efficient and result in faster load times.

- Performance-Critical Animations: In cases where highly performant animations are required, directly manipulating the DOM with optimized vanilla JavaScript or using specialized animation libraries can outperform React's Virtual DOM approach.

- Minimal Interactivity: If a website or web application requires minimal interactivity and does not have complex user interfaces or data manipulation, using React may introduce unnecessary complexity, and vanilla JavaScript may be more straightforward and faster.

- Small Codebases: For small projects or one-off pages that do not require extensive UI components or complex state management, React's overhead might not be justified, and writing plain HTML/JS can be more lightweight and faster.

- Server-Side Rendering: In some cases, server-side rendering (SSR) without React might be faster for initial page load, especially for static content or content that does not require client-side interactivity.

- Legacy Systems: When working with legacy systems or projects built using older technology stacks, integrating React might not be feasible or practical. In such cases, sticking with the existing HTML/JS code might be the more suitable option.

- SEO and Page Load Speed: For certain SEO-focused websites or pages that prioritize fast initial page load times, using plain HTML/JS can result in faster rendering, as it avoids the overhead of client-side rendering.

It's important to note that the choice between React and traditional HTML/JS depends on various factors, including project requirements, development team expertise, performance goals, and the complexity of the application. React's strength lies in its component-based architecture, state management, and developer-friendly ecosystem, making it an excellent choice for most modern web applications. However, for specific use cases with specific performance or project constraints, traditional HTML/JS solutions can still be a viable and efficient option.

## How do you manipulate DOM using a service worker

Service worker can't access the DOM directly. But it can communicate with the pages it controls by responding to messages sent via the `postMessage` interface, and those pages can manipulate the DOM.

   

## How do you reuse information across service worker restarts

The problem with service worker is that it gets terminated when not in use, and restarted when it's next needed, so you cannot rely on global state within a service worker's `onfetch` and `onmessage` handlers. In this case, service workers will have access to IndexedDB API in order to persist and reuse across restarts.


## How do I modify the url without reloading the page

The `window.location.href` property will be helpful to modify the url but it reloads the page. HTML5 introduced the `history.pushState()` and `history.replaceState()` methods, which allow you to add and modify history entries, respectively. For example, you can use pushState as below,

```javascript
window.history.pushState("page2", "Title", "/page2.html");
```  

## How to get the value from get parameters

The `new URL()` object accepts the url string and `searchParams` property of this object can be used to access the get parameters. Remember that you may need to use polyfill or `window.location` to access the URL in older browsers(including IE).

- We get all params by using `url.searchParams`
- We get specific params by using `url.searchParams.get("paramName")`



```javascript
let urlString = "https://www.tamaldas.com?by-date=yes&sort=true"; 
let url = new URL(urlString);

let parameter = url.searchParams;
let parameterByName = url.searchParams.get("sort");

console.log(parameter); 
```

OUTPUT

```bash

URL 
{
  href: 'https://www.tamaldas.com/?by-date=yes&sort=true',
  origin: 'https://www.tamaldas.com',
  protocol: 'https:',
  username: '',
  password: '',
  host: 'www.tamaldas.com',
  hostname: 'www.tamaldas.com',
  port: '',
  pathname: '/',
  search: '?by-date=yes&sort=true',
  searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'by-date' => 'yes', 'sort' => 'true' },
  hash: ''
}

URLSearchParams { 'by-date' => 'yes', 'sort' => 'true' }

```
    ## What are the different methods to find HTML elements in DOM

If you want to access any element in an HTML page, you need to start with accessing the document object. Later you can use any of the below methods to find the HTML element,

1. document.getElementById(id): It finds an element by Id
2. document.getElementsByTagName(name): It finds an element by tag name
3. document.getElementsByClassName(name): It finds an element by class name

## Is JavaScript faster than server side script

Yes, JavaScript is faster than server side scripts. Because JavaScript is a client-side script it does not require any web server‚Äôs help for its computation or calculation. So JavaScript is always faster than any server-side script like ASP, PHP, etc.


## Is it possible to debug HTML elements in console

Yes, it is possible to get and debug HTML elements in the console just like inspecting elements.

```javascript
const element = document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0];
console.log(element);
```
## How do you change the style of a HTML element using JS

You can change inline style or classname of a HTML element using javascript

1. **Using style property:** You can modify inline style using style property

```javascript
document.getElementById("title").style.fontSize = "30px";
```

2. **Using ClassName property:** It is easy to modify element class using className property

```javascript
document.getElementById("title").className = "custom-title";
```
## How do you create custom HTML element?

The creation of custom HTML elements involves two main steps,

1. **Define your custom HTML element:** First you need to define some custom class by extending HTMLElement class.
        After that define your component properties (styles,text etc) using `connectedCallback` method.
        **Note:** The browser exposes a function called `customElements.define` inorder to reuse the element.
        ```javascript
        class CustomElement extends HTMLElement {
          connectedCallback() {
            this.innerHTML = "This is a custom element";
          }
        }
        customElements.define("custom-element", CustomElement);
        ```
2. **Use custome element just like other HTML element:** Declare your custom element as a HTML tag.

```javascript
<body>
<custom-element>
</body>
```     

## What are the properties used to get size of window

You can use innerWidth, innerHeight, clientWidth, clientHeight properties of windows, document element and document body objects to find the size of a window. Let's use them combination of these properties to calculate the size of a window or document,

```javascript
var width = window.innerWidth ||
document.documentElement.clientWidth ||
document.body.clientWidth;

var height =
       window.innerHeight ||
       document.documentElement.clientHeight ||
       document.body.clientHeight;
```

## What is the difference between document load and DOMContentLoaded events

The `DOMContentLoaded` event is fired when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for assets(stylesheets, images, and subframes) to finish loading. Whereas The load event is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources(stylesheets, images).

## What is the difference between an attribute and a property

Attributes are defined on the HTML markup whereas properties are defined on the DOM. For example, the below HTML element has 2 attributes type and value,

```javascript
<input type="text" value="Name:">
```

You can retrieve the attribute value as below,

```javascript
const input = document.querySelector("input");
console.log(input.getAttribute("value")); // Good morning
console.log(input.value); // Good morning
```

And after you change the value of the text field to "Good evening", it becomes like

```javascript
console.log(input.getAttribute("value")); // Good evening
console.log(input.value); // Good evening
```

## How do you redirect new page in javascript

In vanilla javascript, you can redirect to a new page using the `location` property of window object. The syntax would be as follows,

```javascript
function redirect() {
  window.location.href = "newPage.html";
}
```

# What is a void operator

The `void` operator evaluates the given expression and then returns undefined(i.e, without returning value). The syntax would be as below,

```javascript
void expression;
void expression;
```

Let's display a message without any redirection or reload

```javascript
<a href="javascript:void(alert('Welcome to JS world'))">
  Click here to see a message
</a>
```

    

# How do you create an infinite loop

You can create infinite loops using for and while loops without using any expressions. The for loop construct or syntax is better approach in terms of ESLint and code optimizer tools,

```javascript
for (;;) {}
while (true) {}
``` 
# ES6 üëáüèª
## What is ES6

ES6 is the sixth edition of the javascript language and it was released in June 2015. It was initially known as ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and later renamed to ECMAScript 2015. Almost all the modern browsers support ES6 but for the old browsers there are many transpilers, like Babel.js etc.

## List down some of the features of ES6

Below are the list of some new features of ES6,

1. Support for constants or immutable variables
2. Block-scope support for variables, constants and functions
3. Arrow functions
4. Default parameters
5. Rest and Spread Parameters
6. Template Literals
7. Multi-line Strings
8. Destructuring Assignment
9. Enhanced Object Literals
10. Promises
11. Classes
12. Modules

    



    




    

# What is destructuring assignment

The destructuring assignment is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.
    

```javascript
var [one, two, three] = ["JAN", "FEB", "MARCH"];

console.log(one); // "JAN"
console.log(two); // "FEB"
console.log(three); // "MARCH"
```

and you can get user properties of an object using destructuring assignment,

```javascript
var { name, age } = { name: "John", age: 32 };

console.log(name); // John
console.log(age); // 32
```

    

# What are default values in destructuring assignment

A variable can be assigned a default value when the value unpacked from the array or object is undefined during destructuring assignment. It helps to avoid setting default values separately for each assignment. Let's take an example for both arrays and object use cases,

**Arrays destructuring:**

```javascript
var x, y, z;

[x = 2, y = 4, z = 6] = [10];
console.log(x); // 10
console.log(y); // 4
console.log(z); // 6
```

**Objects destructuring:**

```javascript
var { x = 2, y = 4, z = 6 } = { x: 10 };

console.log(x); // 10
console.log(y); // 4
console.log(z); // 6
```

    

# How do you swap variables in destructuring assignment

If you don't use destructuring assignment, swapping two values requires a temporary variable. Whereas using a destructuring feature, two variable values can be swapped in one destructuring expression. Let's swap two number variables in array destructuring assignment,

```javascript
var x = 10,
y = 20;

[x, y] = [y, x];
console.log(x); // 20
console.log(y); // 10
```
# What are dynamic importss

The dynamic imports using `import()` function syntax allows us to load modules on demand by using promises or the async/await syntax. Currently this feature is in [stage4 proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import). The main advantage of dynamic imports is reduction of our bundle's sizes, the size/payload response of our requests and overall improvements in the user experience.
     The syntax of dynamic imports would be as below,

```javascript
import("./Module").then((Module) => Module.method());
```




# How do you trim a string at the beginning or ending

The `trim` method of string prototype is used to trim on both sides of a string. But if you want to trim especially at the beginning or ending of the string then you can use `trimStart/trimLeft` and `trimEnd/trimRight` methods. Let's see an example of these methods on a greeting message,

```javascript
var greeting = "   Hello, Goodmorning!   ";

console.log(greeting); // "   Hello, Goodmorning!   "
console.log(greeting.trimStart()); // "Hello, Goodmorning!   "
console.log(greeting.trimLeft()); // "Hello, Goodmorning!   "

console.log(greeting.trimEnd()); // "   Hello, Goodmorning!"
console.log(greeting.trimRight()); // "   Hello, Goodmorning!"
```


# What is a thunk function

A thunk is just a function which delays the evaluation of the value. It doesn‚Äôt take any arguments but gives the value whenever you invoke the thunk. i.e, It is used not to execute now but it will be sometime in the future. Let's take a synchronous example,

```javascript
const add = (x, y) => x + y;

const thunk = () => add(2, 3);

thunk(); // 5
```

# What are asynchronous thunks

The asynchronous thunks are useful to make network requests. Let's see an example of network requests,

```javascript
function fetchData(fn) {
  fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((json) => fn(json));
}

const asyncThunk = function () {
  return fetchData(function getData(data) {
    console.log(data);
  });
};

asyncThunk();
```

The `getData` function won't be called immediately but it will be invoked only when the data is available from API endpoint. The setTimeout function is also used to make our code asynchronous. The best real time example is redux state management library which uses the asynchronous thunks to delay the actions to dispatch.

# How do you rounding numbers to certain decimals

You can round numbers to a certain number of decimals using `toFixed` method from native javascript.

```javascript
let pie = 3.141592653;
pie = pie.toFixed(3); // 3.142
```



# What are the placeholders from console object

Below are the list of placeholders available from console object,

1. %o ‚Äî It takes an object,
2. %s ‚Äî It takes a string,
3. %d ‚Äî It is used for a decimal or integer


```javascript
const user = { name: "John", id: 1, city: "Delhi" };
console.log(
  "Hello %s, your details %o are available in the object form",
  "John",
  user
); // Hello John, your details {name: "John", id: 1, city: "Delhi"} available in object
```


# What is the purpose of dir method of console object

The `console.dir()` is used to display an interactive list of the properties of the specified JavaScript object as JSON.

```javascript
const user = { name: "John", id: 1, city: "Delhi" };
console.dir(user);
```



# How do you display data in a tabular format using console object

The `console.table()` is used to display data in the console in a tabular format to visualize complex arrays or objects.

```js
const users = [
  { name: "John", id: 1, city: "Delhi" },
  { name: "Max", id: 2, city: "London" },
  { name: "Rod", id: 3, city: "Paris" },
];
console.table(users);
```


# How do you verify that an argument is a Number or not

The combination of IsNaN and isFinite methods are used to confirm whether an argument is a number or not.

```javascript
function isNumber(n) {
  return !isNaN(parseFloat(n)) && isFinite(n);
}
```

# What are the built-in iterables

Below are the list of built-in iterables in javascript,

1. Arrays and TypedArrays
2. Strings: Iterate over each character or Unicode code-points
3. Maps: iterate over its key-value pairs
4. Sets: iterates over their elements
5. arguments: An array-like special variable in functions
6. DOM collection such as NodeList
    

# What is the difference between isNaN and Number.isNaN?

1. **isNaN**: The global function `isNaN` converts the argument to a Number and returns true if the resulting value is NaN.
2. **Number.isNaN**: This method does not convert the argument. But it returns true when the type is a Number and value is NaN.

Let's see the difference with an example,

```javascript
isNaN(‚Äòhello‚Äô);   // true
Number.isNaN('hello'); // false
```
    

# Is that possible to use expressions in switch cases?

You might have seen expressions used in switch condition but it is also possible to use for switch cases by assigning true value for the switch condition. Let's see the weather condition based on temparature as an example,

```js
const weather = (function getWeather(temp) {
  switch (true) {
    case temp < 0:
      return "freezing";
    case temp < 10:
      return "cold";
    case temp < 24:
      return "cool";
    default:
      return "unknown";
  }
})(10);
```
    

# How do style the console output using CSS?

You can add CSS styling to the console output using the CSS format content specifier %c. The console string message can be appended after the specifier and CSS style in another argument. Let's print the red the color text using console.log and CSS specifier as below,

```js
console.log("%cThis is a red text", "color:red");
```

It is also possible to add more styles for the content. For example, the font-size can be modified for the above text

```js
console.log(
  "%cThis is a red text with bigger font",
  "color:red; font-size:20px"
);
```
 


    

# What is the difference between setTimeout, setImmediate and process.nextTick?

     1. **Set Timeout:** setTimeout() is to schedule execution of a one-time callback after delay milliseconds.
     2. **Set Immediate:** The setImmediate function is used to execute a function right after the current event loop finishes.
     3. **Process NextTick:** If process.nextTick() is called in a given phase, all the callbacks passed to process.nextTick() will be resolved before the event loop continues. This will block the event loop and create I/O Starvation if process.nextTick() is called recursively.

    




 

# What is pass by value and pass by reference?
Pass-by-value creates a new space in memory and makes a copy of a value. Primitives such as string, number, boolean etc will actually create a new copy. Hence, updating one value doesn't impact the other value. i.e, The values are independent of each other.

```javascript
let a = 5;
let b = a;

b++;
console.log(a, b); //5, 6
```
In the above code snippet, the value of `a` is assigned to `b` and the variable `b` has been incremented. Since there is a new space created for variable `b`, any update on this variable doesn't impact the variable `a`.

Pass by reference doesn't create a new space in memory but the new variable adopts a memory address of an initial variable. Non-primitives such as objects, arrays and functions gets the reference of the initiable variable. i.e, updating one value will impact the other variable.

```javascript
let user1 = {
   name: 'John',
   age: 27
};
let user2 = user1;
user2.age = 30;

console.log(user1.age, user2.age); // 30, 30
```

In the above code snippet, updating the `age` property of one object will impact the other property due to the same reference.

# What are the differences between primitives and non-primitives?

JavaScript language has both primitives and non-primitives but there are few differences between them as below,

| Primitives                 | Non-primitives       |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| These types are predefined | Created by developer |
| These are immutable        | Mutable              |
| Compare by value           | Compare by reference |
| Stored in Stack            | Stored in heap       |
| Contain certain value      | Can contain NULL too |

 

# What is referential transparency?

  An expression in javascript can be replaced by its value without affecting the behaviour of the program is called referential transparency. Pure functions are referentially transparent.

```javascript
const add = (x,y) => x + y;
const multiplyBy2 = (x) => x * 2;

//Now add (2, 3) can be replaced by 5.

multiplyBy2(add(2, 3)); 
```

 

# What are the possible side-effects in javascript?
A side effect is the modification of state through the invocation of a function or expression. These side effects makes our function impure by default. Below are some side effects which makes function impure,

1. Making an HTTP request. Asynchronous functions such as fetch and promise are impure.
2. DOM manipulations
3. Mutating the input data
4. Printing to a screen or console: For example, console.log() and alert() 
5. Fetching the current time
6. Math.random() calls: Modifies the internal state of Math object




# What are regular expression patterns

Regular Expressions provide a group of patterns in order to match characters. Basically they are categorized into 3 types,

1. **Brackets:** These are used to find a range of characters.
        For example, below are some use cases,
        1. [abc]: Used to find any of the characters between the brackets(a,b,c)
        2. [0-9]: Used to find any of the digits between the brackets
        3. (a|b): Used to find any of the alternatives separated with |
2. **Metacharacters:** These are characters with a special meaning
        For example, below are some use cases,
        1. \\d: Used to find a digit
        2. \\s: Used to find a whitespace character
        3. \\b: Used to find a match at the beginning or ending of a word
3. **Quantifiers:** These are useful to define quantities
        For example, below are some use cases,
        1. n+: Used to find matches for any string that contains at least one n
        2. n\*: Used to find matches for any string that contains zero or more occurrences of n
        3. n?: Used to find matches for any string that contains zero or one occurrences of n

# How do you search a string for a pattern

     You can use the test() method of regular expression in order to search a string for a pattern, and return true or false depending on the result.

     ```javascript
     var pattern = /you/;
     console.log(pattern.test("How are you?")); //true
     ```
# What would be the result of `1+2+'3'`

The output is going to be `33`. Since `1` and `2` are numeric values, the result of the first two digits is going to be a numeric value `3`. The next digit is a string type value because of that the addition of numeric value `3` and string type value `3` is just going to be a concatenation value `33`.
    
# Dates in JS üëáüèª
## How do you convert date to another timezone in javascript

You can use the toLocaleString() method to convert dates in one timezone to another. For example, let's convert current date to British English timezone as below,

```javascript
console.log(event.toLocaleString("en-GB", { timeZone: "UTC" })); //29/06/2019, 09:56:00
```

## What is the `toLocaleString()` method ? 

The `toLocaleString()` method returns a string with a language-sensitive representation of this date. The new locales and options arguments let applications specify the language whose formatting conventions should be used and allow to customize the behavior of the function. In older implementations, which ignore the locales and options arguments, the locale used and the form of the string returned are entirely implementation dependent.

```javascript

const d = new Date();
let text = d.toLocaleString();

console.log(d); // 2023-07-18T17:35:09.632Z
console.log(text); // 7/18/2023, 5:34:55 PM
```

## How do you display the current date in javascript

You can use `new Date()` to generate a new Date object containing the current date and time. For example, let's display the current date in mm/dd/yyyy

```javascript
var today = new Date();
var dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, "0");
var mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, "0"); //January is 0!
var yyyy = today.getFullYear();

today = mm + "/" + dd + "/" + yyyy;
document.write(today);
```
## How do you compare two date objects

You need to use date.getTime() method to compare date values instead of comparison operators (==, !=, ===, and !== operators)

```javascript
var d1 = new Date();
var d2 = new Date(d1);
console.log(d1.getTime() === d2.getTime()); //True
console.log(d1 === d2); // False
```

# What are the ways to execute javascript after page load

You can execute javascript after page load in many different ways,

1. **window.onload:**

```javascript
window.onload = function ...
```

2. **document.onload:**

```javascript
document.onload = function ...
```

3. **body onload:**

```javascript
<body onload="script();">
```
    
# What is a freeze method

The **freeze()** method is used to freeze an object. Freezing an object does not allow adding new properties to an object,prevents from removing and prevents changing the enumerability, configurability, or writability of existing properties. i.e, It returns the passed object and does not create a frozen copy.

```javascript
const obj = {
  prop: 100,
};

Object.freeze(obj);
obj.prop = 200; // Throws an error in strict mode

console.log(obj.prop); //100
```

Remember freezing is only applied to the top-level properties in objects but not for nested objects. For example, let's try to freeze user object which has employment details as nested object and observe that details have been changed.

```javascript
const user = {
  name: 'John',
  employment: {
    department: 'IT'
  }
};

Object.freeze(user);
user.employment.department = 'HR';
```


**Note:** It causes a TypeError if the argument passed is not an object.

    
# What is the purpose of freeze method

Below are the main benefits of using freeze method,

1. It is used for freezing objects and arrays.
2. It is used to make an object immutable.

    

# Why do I need to use freeze method

In the Object-oriented paradigm, an existing API contains certain elements that are not intended to be extended, modified, or re-used outside of their current context. Hence it works as the `final` keyword which is used in various languages.

    

# How to convert string to title case with javascript

     Title case means that the first letter of each word is capitalized. You can convert a string to title case using the below function,

     ```javascript
     function toTitleCase(str) {
       return str.replace(/\w\S*/g, function (txt) {
         return txt.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + txt.substring(1).toLowerCase();
       });
     }
     toTitleCase("good morning john"); // Good Morning John
     ```

    

# How do you detect javascript disabled in the page

     You can use the `<noscript>` tag to detect javascript disabled or not. The code block inside `<noscript>` gets executed when JavaScript is disabled, and is typically used to display alternative content when the page generated in JavaScript.

     ```javascript
     <script type="javascript">
         // JS related code goes here
     </script>
     <noscript>
         <a href="next_page.html?noJS=true">JavaScript is disabled in the page. Please click Next Page</a>
     </noscript>
     ```

# How do you get enumerable key and value pairs

The Object.entries() method is used to return an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs, in the same order as that provided by a for...in loop. Let's see the functionality of object.entries() method in an example,

```javascript
const object = {
  a: "Good morning",
  b: 100,
};

for (let [key, value] of Object.entries(object)) {
  console.log(`${key}: ${value}`); // a: 'Good morning'
  // b: 100
}
```

**Note:** The order is not guaranteed as object defined.

    

# What is the main difference between Object.values and Object.entries method

The Object.values() method's behavior is similar to Object.entries() method but it returns an array of values instead [key,value] pairs.

```javascript
const object = {
  a: "Good morning",
  b: 100,
};

for (let value of Object.values(object)) {
  console.log(`${value}`); // 'Good morning'
  100;
}
```


# What is the precedence order between local and global variables

A local variable takes precedence over a global variable with the same name. Let's see this behavior in an example.

```javascript
var msg = "Good morning";
function greeting() {
  msg = "Good Evening";
  console.log(msg); // Good Evening
}
greeting();
```


# What are javascript accessors

ECMAScript 5 introduced javascript object accessors or computed properties through getters and setters. Getters uses the `get` keyword whereas Setters uses the `set` keyword.

```javascript
var user = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName : "Abraham",
  language : "en",
  get lang() {
    return this.language;
  },
  set lang(lang) {
  this.language = lang;
  }
};
console.log(user.lang); // getter access lang as en
user.lang = 'fr';
console.log(user.lang); // setter used to set lang as fr
```

# What are primitive data types

A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value (which has no properties or methods). There are 7 types of primitive data types.

1. string
2. number
3. boolean
4. null
5. undefined
6. bigint
7. symbol


# What are the different error names from error object

There are 6 different types of error names returned from error object,
| Error Name     | Description                                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| EvalError      | An error has occurred in the eval() function       |
| RangeError     | An error has occurred with a number "out of range" |
| ReferenceError | An error due to an illegal reference               |
| SyntaxError    | An error due to a syntax error                     |
| TypeError      | An error due to a type error                       |
| URIError       | An error due to encodeURI()                        |

# What are the various statements in error handling

Below are the list of statements used in an error handling,

1. **try:** This statement is used to test a block of code for errors
2. **catch:** This statement is used to handle the error
3. **throw:** This statement is used to create custom errors.
4. **finally:** This statement is used to execute code after try and catch regardless of the result.

# What are the two types of loops in javascript

1. **Entry Controlled loops:** In this kind of loop type, the test condition is tested before entering the loop body. For example, For Loop and While Loop comes under this category.
2. **Exit Controlled Loops:** In this kind of loop type, the test condition is tested or evaluated at the end of the loop body. i.e, the loop body will execute at least once irrespective of test condition true or false. For example, do-while loop comes under this category.

# How do you perform language specific date and time formatting

You can use the `Intl.DateTimeFormat` object which is a constructor for objects that enable language-sensitive date and time formatting. Let's see this behavior with an example,

```javascript
var date = new Date(Date.UTC(2019, 07, 07, 3, 0, 0));
console.log(new Intl.DateTimeFormat("en-GB").format(date)); // 07/082019
console.log(new Intl.DateTimeFormat("en-AU").format(date)); // 07/082019
```
# JS vs TS üëáüèª  

## What are the differences between javascript and typescript

Below are the list of differences between javascript and typescript,

| feature             | typescript                            | javascript                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Language paradigm   | Object oriented programming language  | Scripting language                              |
| Typing support      | Supports static typing                | It has dynamic typing                           |
| Modules             | Supported                             | Not supported                                   |
| Interface           | It has interfaces concept             | Doesn't support interfaces                      |
| Optional parameters | Functions support optional parameters | No support of optional parameters for functions |

    

## What are the advantages of typescript over javascript

Below are some of the advantages of typescript over javascript,

1. TypeScript is able to find compile time errors at the development time only and it makes sures less runtime errors. Whereas javascript is an interpreted language.
2. TypeScript is strongly-typed or supports static typing which allows for checking type correctness at compile time. This is not available in javascript.
3. TypeScript compiler can compile the .ts files into ES3,ES4 and ES5 unlike ES6 features of javascript which may not be supported in some browsers.

# Minification üëáüèª

## What is Minification

Minification is the process of removing all unnecessary characters(empty spaces are removed) and variables will be renamed without changing it's functionality. It is also a type of obfuscation .

    

## What are the advantages of minification

Normally it is recommended to use minification for heavy traffic and intensive requirements of resources. It reduces file sizes with below benefits,

1. Decreases loading times of a web page
2. Saves bandwidth usages


# JSON üëáüèª

## What is JSON

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format that is used for data interchanging. It is based on a subset of JavaScript language in the way objects are built in JavaScript.

    

## What are the syntax rules of JSON

Below are the list of syntax rules of JSON

1. The data is in name/value pairs
2. The data is separated by commas
3. Curly braces hold objects
4. Square brackets hold arrays

    

## What is the purpose JSON stringify

When sending data to a web server, the data has to be in a string format. You can achieve this by converting JSON object into a string using stringify() method.

```javascript
var userJSON = { name: "John", age: 31 };
var userString = JSON.stringify(userJSON);
console.log(userString); //"{"name":"John","age":31}"
```

    

## How do you parse JSON string

When receiving the data from a web server, the data is always in a string format. But you can convert this string value to a javascript object using parse() method.

```javascript
var userString = '{"name":"John","age":31}';
var userJSON = JSON.parse(userString);
console.log(userJSON); // {name: "John", age: 31}
```

    

## Why do you need JSON

When exchanging data between a browser and a server, the data can only be text. Since JSON is text only, it can easily be sent to and from a server, and used as a data format by any programming language.

## How do you define JSON arrays

JSON arrays are written inside square brackets and arrays contain javascript objects. For example, the JSON array of users would be as below,

```javascript
"users":[
  {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Abrahm"},
  {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
  {"firstName":"Shane", "lastName":"Warn"}
]
```
   
# What is NaN property

The NaN property is a global property that represents "Not-a-Number" value. i.e, It indicates that a value is not a legal number. It is very rare to use NaN in a program but it can be used as return value for few cases

```javascript
Math.sqrt(-1);
parseInt("Hello");
```

   

# What is the purpose of isFinite function

The isFinite() function is used to determine whether a number is a finite, legal number. It returns false if the value is +infinity, -infinity, or NaN (Not-a-Number), otherwise it returns true.

```javascript
isFinite(Infinity); // false
isFinite(NaN); // false
isFinite(-Infinity); // false

isFinite(100); // true
```

# How do you submit a form using JavaScript

You can submit a form using `document.forms[0].submit()`. All the form input's information is submitted using onsubmit event handler

```javascript
function submit() {
  document.forms[0].submit();
}
```
  

# What is the difference between native, host and user objects

- `Native objects` are objects that are part of the JavaScript language defined by the ECMAScript specification. For example, String, Math, RegExp, Object, Function etc core objects defined in the ECMAScript spec.
- `Host objects` are objects provided by the browser or runtime environment (Node). For example, window, XmlHttpRequest, DOM nodes etc are considered as host objects.
- `User objects` are objects defined in the javascript code. For example, User objects created for profile information.

# What is same-origin policy

The same-origin policy is a policy that prevents JavaScript from making requests across domain boundaries. An origin is defined as a combination of URI scheme, hostname, and port number. If you enable this policy then it prevents a malicious script on one page from obtaining access to sensitive data on another web page using Document Object Model(DOM).

   

# JS Basics üëáüèª
   

## Is JavaScript a compiled or interpreted language

JavaScript is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. An interpreter in the browser reads over the JavaScript code, interprets each line, and runs it. Nowadays modern browsers use a technology known as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which compiles JavaScript to executable bytecode just as it is about to run.

   

## Is JavaScript a case-sensitive language

Yes, JavaScript is a case sensitive language. The language keywords, variables, function & object names, and any other identifiers must always be typed with a consistent capitalization of letters.

## Why is JavaScript treated as Single threaded

JavaScript is a single-threaded language. Because the language specification does not allow the programmer to write code so that the interpreter can run parts of it in parallel in multiple threads or processes. Whereas languages like java, go, C++ can make multi-threaded and multi-process programs. 

## Is there any relation between Java and JavaScript

No, they are entirely two different programming languages and have nothing to do with each other. But both of them are Object Oriented Programming languages and like many other languages, they follow similar syntax for basic features(if, else, for, switch, break, continue etc).

## What is jQuery

jQuery is a popular cross-browser JavaScript library that provides Document Object Model (DOM) traversal, event handling, animations and AJAX interactions by minimizing the discrepancies across browsers. 

```javascript
$(document).ready(function () {
  // It selects the document and apply the function on page load
  alert("Welcome to jQuery world");
});
```
    

## Why do we call javascript as dynamic language

JavaScript is a loosely typed or a dynamic language because variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned/reassigned with values of all types.

```javascript
let age = 50; // age is a number now
age = "old"; // age is a string now
age = true; // age is a boolean
```


# What is BOM

The Browser Object Model (BOM) allows JavaScript to "talk to" the browser. It consists of the objects navigator, history, screen, location and document which are children of the window. The Browser Object Model is not standardized and can change based on different browsers.

    

# What is the use of setInterval

The setInterval() method is used to call a function or evaluate an expression at specified intervals (in milliseconds). For example, let's log a message after 2 seconds using setInterval method,

```javascript
setInterval(function () {
  console.log("Good morning");
}, 2000);
```



    

# What are PWAs

Progressive web applications (PWAs) are a type of mobile app delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These PWAs are deployed to servers, accessible through URLs, and indexed by search engines.

# What are the various url properties of location object

The below `Location` object properties can be used to access URL components of the page,

1. href - The entire URL
2. protocol - The protocol of the URL
3. host - The hostname and port of the URL
4. hostname - The hostname of the URL
5. port - The port number in the URL
6. pathname - The path name of the URL
7. search - The query portion of the URL
8. hash - The anchor portion of the URL


 # How do you add a key value pair in javascript

There are two possible solutions to add new properties to an object. Let's take a simple object to explain these solutions.

```javascript
var object = {
  key1: value1,
  key2: value2,
};
```

1. **Using dot notation:** This solution is useful when you know the name of the property

```javascript
object.key3 = "value3";
```

2. **Using square bracket notation:** This solution is useful when the name of the property is dynamically determined.

```javascript
obj["key3"] = "value3";
```

# Is the !-- notation represents a special operator

No,that's not a special operator. But it is a combination of 2 standard operators one after the other,

1. A logical not (!)
2. A prefix decrement (--)

At first, the value decremented by one and then tested to see if it is equal to zero or not for determining the truthy/falsy value.

# What is a polyfill

A polyfill is a piece of JS code used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it. For example, Silverlight plugin polyfill can be used to mimic the functionality of an HTML Canvas element on Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.


export default ({children}) => <div className="prose md">{children}</div>
