# What are even hooks ?

Well they are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. Hooks don't work inside classes â€” they let you use React without classes.

# How did hooks help us ?

Hooks revolutionized React development by simplifying state management, promoting reusability, and enhancing the separation of concerns in components. They eliminated the need for class-based components and complex lifecycle methods, leading to cleaner and more organized code. Custom hooks further extended the benefits of hooks, allowing developers to create reusable, encapsulated logic. The introduction of hooks significantly improved the coding experience, making React development more intuitive, efficient, and maintainable.

# What are states in component ?

State is a JavaScript object that stores a component's dynamic data and determines the component's behavior. It is managed internally by the component itself and can only be updated by the component itself. State is used to store data that can change over time, such as user input, network responses, and UI events.

## Before hooks did the components have state ?

Yes, before the introduction of hooks in React, components could still have state. Stateful components were commonly created using class-based components, where state was managed through the this.state property. Class-based components had a constructor method to initialize the state and various lifecycle methods (e.g., componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, etc.) to handle state updates and side effects.

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Counter extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0,
    };
  }

  incrementCount() {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
        <button onClick={() => this.incrementCount()}>Increment</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

While class-based components were widely used, they sometimes led to complex and less reusable code. Hooks were introduced as a way to simplify state management and side effects in functional components, making it easier to work with state and promoting better code organization and reusability.

## If we have `const x = 10;` is that a state too ?

No, const x = 10; is not considered state in the context of React components.

In React, "state" refers to any data that can change over time and affects the rendering of a component. It is used to manage dynamic values that can be modified and trigger re-rendering of the component when they change.

The code const x = 10; is simply assigning the value 10 to a constant variable x, which means x has a fixed value of 10 throughout the component's life cycle. This is not considered state because it doesn't change during the component's rendering or interaction with the user.

In contrast, React state is typically used when you want to track and update data that can change in response to user actions, network requests, or other events. This dynamic behavior is what makes state essential for building interactive and responsive user interfaces.


# Component Lifecycle Method

In React, the term "lifecycle" refers to the different stages that a component goes through from its creation to its removal from the DOM. During each stage of a component's lifecycle, React provides developers with specific methods that can be overridden to perform actions or handle behaviors related to that particular stage.

The React component lifecycle can be divided into three main phases:

## Mounting Phase:

This is the initial phase when a component is being created and inserted into the DOM. It involves methods that are called when the component is being mounted. Lifecycle methods in this phase are called in the following order: `constructor()`, `static getDerivedStateFromProps()`, `render()`, and `componentDidMount()`.


## Updating Phase:

This phase occurs when a component's props or state change, causing it to re-render.
It involves methods that are called when the component is being updated.
Lifecycle methods in this phase are called in the following order: static getDerivedStateFromProps(), shouldComponentUpdate(), render(), getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(), and componentDidUpdate().


## Unmounting Phase:

This phase occurs when a component is being removed from the DOM.
It involves methods that are called when the component is being unmounted.
The only lifecycle method in this phase is componentWillUnmount(), which allows developers to perform cleanup tasks before the component is removed. Additionally, there is a newer error handling phase introduced in React 16.

## Error Handling Phase:
This phase is related to handling errors that occur during rendering, lifecycle methods, or inside child components.
It involves two error handling methods: static getDerivedStateFromError() and componentDidCatch().
It's essential to understand the component lifecycle because it provides developers with opportunities to perform specific tasks at different stages of a component's existence. However, with the introduction of React Hooks, the traditional class-based lifecycle methods are being replaced in favor of using functional components with hooks like useState, useEffect, etc. These hooks provide a more straightforward and predictable way to manage component behavior without relying on class components and their lifecycle methods.


# `useState()` Hook

useState is a React Hook that lets you add state to functional components. It takes an initial value as an argument and returns an array of two values: the current state and a function to update it.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <div>Count: {count}</div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the count state is created using the useState hook. The count state is initialized to 0, and the setCount function is used to update the count state. When the button is clicked, the count state is updated using the setCount function, which causes the component to re-render.

## Tricky Questions on useState

### Question 1

<Assignment isQuestion={true} details={"Explain the concept of functional updates with `useState`. Why might you use a function as an argument to `setState`?"}/>

Functional updates allow you to update state based on its previous value, ensuring that you're working with the latest state. Using a function in `setState` is crucial in scenarios where state updates are asynchronous.

```jsx

const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

// Without functional update
const handleClickWithoutFunctionalUpdate = () => {
  setCount(count + 1); // May not reflect the latest state immediately
};

// With functional update
const handleClickWithFunctionalUpdate = () => {
  setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1); // Ensures you're working with the latest state
};

```


### Question 2
<Assignment isQuestion={true} details={"How would you manage multiple state variables using `useState`? What considerations should be taken into account when dealing with complex state?"}/>

To manage multiple state variables using `useState`, you can call the hook multiple times, each time for a different state variable. However, for complex state, consider grouping related pieces of state together or using `useReducer` for more structured state management.

```jsx

const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);

// Grouping related state
const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: '', age: 0 });

// Using useReducer for complex state
const initialState = { count: 0, isActive: false };
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  // Handle state updates based on the action
};

const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
```

### Question 3

<Assignment isQuestion={true} details={"Discuss why React uses a shallow comparison to determine if the state has changed in the context of `useState`. How might this impact your application?"}/>

React uses a shallow comparison in `useState` to determine if the state has changed for efficiency reasons. Shallow comparison involves comparing references, not the content of objects.  This impacts applications when dealing with complex objects in state, as changes within nested structures might not trigger a re-render.  Developers need to be cautious and consider using immutable data structures or specialized libraries like Immer for complex state.

```jsx
const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: 'John', age: 25 });

// Incorrect update (no re-render)
setUser({ ...user, age: 26 });
// Shallow comparison doesn't detect the change within the user object

// Correct update (triggers re-render)
setUser(prevUser => ({ ...prevUser, age: 26 }));
// Functional update ensures the correct reference is used
```
### Question 4

<Assignment isQuestion={true} details={"Does the `useState` update function always trigger an immediate re-render? How does the asynchronous nature of state updates affect the rendering cycle?"}/>

The `useState` update function is asynchronous, and state updates may not immediately trigger a re-render. React batches updates for performance reasons. This asynchronous nature can lead to unexpected results if not handled carefully.

```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

// Incorrect usage
const handleClick = () => {
  setCount(count + 1); // May not reflect the latest state immediately
};

// Correct usage (ensures the correct state is used)
const handleClickAsync = () => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
  }, 0);
};
```

### Question 5
<Assignment isQuestion={true} details={"Why is it recommended to use the functional update form of `setState` when the new state depends on the previous state? Provide an example where not using the functional update form could lead to issues."}/>

Using the functional update form ensures that you're working with the latest state, which is crucial in scenarios where multiple state updates occur in quick succession.

```jsx

const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

// Incorrect usage (may not reflect the latest state)
const incrementCountIncorrectly = () => {
  setCount(count + 1);
};

// Correct usage (ensures the correct state is used)
const incrementCountCorrectly = () => {
  setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
};
```

### Question 6
<Assignment isQuestion={true} details={"How does the initial state work in `useState`? What are the potential pitfalls when initializing state based on the previous state?"}/>

The initial state is only used during the first render. Initializing state based on the previous state without using the functional update form may lead to unexpected behavior, as state updates are asynchronous. Here's an example:

```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

// Incorrect initialization (may not reflect the latest state)
const initializeCountIncorrectly = () => {
  setCount(count + 1);
};

// Correct initialization (ensures the correct state is used)
const initializeCountCorrectly = () => {
  setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
};
```

### Question 7
<Assignment isQuestion={true} details={"When using `useState`, what is the significance of destructuring the array returned by the hook? What happens if you omit one of the elements in the array?"}/>

Destructuring allows you to name the state variables for better clarity. Omitting one of the elements will result in the state variable having `undefined` as its initial value. Here's an example:


```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

// Destructuring for better readability
const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: 'John', age: 25 });

// Omitting one element (undefined initial value)
const [value] = useState(42); // value is initially undefined
```


### Question 8
<Assignment isQuestion={true} details={"How can you encapsulate and reuse state logic with custom hooks? Provide an example of a custom hook that uses `useState`."}/>

Custom hooks are functions that use hooks internally. They can encapsulate and abstract away complex state logic Here's an example of a custom hook using `useState` - a simple counter:

```jsx
const useCounter = (initialCount = 0) => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
  };

  const decrement = () => {
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount - 1);
  };

  return [count, increment, decrement];
};

// Using the custom hook
const CounterComponent = () => {
  const [count, increment, decrement] = useCounter();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
};

```

### Question 9

<Assignment isQuestion={true} details={"Explain how state in a functional component using `useState` is similar to or different from props. Are there scenarios where you might choose one over the other?"}/>

Both state and props represent data in a component. State is internal and can be changed, while props are external and passed down from a parent component.
Use state for dynamic data that changes within the component, and props for passing data from parent to child Here's a brief comparison:

```jsx

const CounterComponent = ({ initialCount }) => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Question 10
<Assignment isQuestion={true} details={"How can you optimize the performance of state updates with `useState`? Discuss scenarios where you might want to use `useReducer` instead of `useState`."}/>

To optimize performance with `useState`, consider using the functional update form when the new state depends on the previous state. For complex state logic, where multiple actions may affect the state, `useReducer` can provide a cleaner and more maintainable solution than multiple `useState` calls. Here's a high-level example:

```jsx
const initialState = { count: 0, isActive: false };

// Using `useState` for simple state
const [count, setCount] = useState(initialState.count);

// Using `useReducer` for complex state
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'TOGGLE_ACTIVE':
      return { ...state, isActive: !state.isActive };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
```

# `useEffect()` Hook

UseEffect in code is used mostly for side effects. Whenever something or the other changes we will be using useEffect to do somethhing else based on the code change. It will run atleast once when the component mounts with the code that it has inside of it's body.

```jsx
import React, { useEffect,useState } from 'react';

function App(){
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(()=>{
    console.log("useEffect called");
  },[count]);

}
```

Here as you can see in this example the useEffect is now hooked to the count and as soon as the count will increase we will be console logging it that is because we have count in the dependency array.

## `useEffect()` with cleanup function

```jsx
import React, { useEffect,useState } from 'react';

function App(){
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(()=>{
    console.log("useEffect called");
    return ()=>{
      console.log("cleanup function called");
    }
  },[count]);

}
```

Now the output of this code will be `cleanup function called` and then `useEffect called` because the cleanup function is called before the useEffect is called. Why does this happen ?

The useffect will run **once at component mount** and then it will run **everytime the dependency array changes**. But when the dependency array changes the cleanup function is called first, then the useEffect destroys the previous effect and then it runs the useEffect again with the new value.

# `UseMemo()` hook

The `useMemo()`  is a React Hook that lets you cache the result of a calculation between re-renders. This can be useful when you have a calculation that is expensive to perform, such as a complex algorithm or a database query.

```js
import React, { useMemo } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const result = useMemo(() => {
    // Perform expensive calculation here
    return count * 2;
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <div>Result: {result}</div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This will be called only when the count state changes & when the component is re-rendered.

## How does useMemo() work behind the scenes?

The useMemo hook is used to memoize a value and recompute it only when its dependencies change. It takes a function and an array of dependencies as arguments. The function is executed initially and whenever any dependency in the array changes. The result of the function is stored and returned as the memoized value.

# `UseCallback()` hook

In React, `useCallback` is a hook that is used to memoize a function so that it is only re-created when one of its dependencies changes. This is similar to useMemo, but instead of memoizing a value, useCallback memoizes a function.

```js

import React, { useCallback } from 'react';

function MyComponent({ value1, value2 }) {
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    console.log('Clicked!');
  }, [onClick]);

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;
}
```

In this example, the handleClick function is memoized using useCallback. This means that the function will only be re-created when the onClick prop changes.

## A more detailed explanation

See everytime a component re-renders, all of its functions are re-created. This is because functions are objects in JavaScript, and objects are created every time they are referenced.

UseCallback will preserve the identity of the function between re-renders, so that it is only re-created when one of its dependencies changes. This can be useful when you have a function that is expensive to create, such as a function that performs a complex calculation or a database query.

# `useReducer()` Hook

useReducer is a hook for state management, much like useState, and relies upon a kind of function called a reducer.

Reducers btw are just pure functions that take the previous state and an action, and return the next state.

useReducer can be used in many of the same ways that useState can, but is more helpful for managing state across multiple components that may involve different operations or "actions".

You will need to reach for useReducer less than useState around your app. But it is very helpful as a powerful means of managing state in smaller applications, rather than having to reach for a third-party state management library like Redux.

```jsx

import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}


function Counter({ initialCount }) {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: initialCount });
  return (
    <>
      Count: {state.count}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>-</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

In this example, the useReducer hook is used to manage the state of the count variable. The reducer function is passed to the useReducer hook as the first argument, and the initial state is passed as the second argument.

# `useContext()` Hook

useContext is a React Hook that lets you read and subscribe to context from your component. It's similar to the useState hook, but instead of managing state, it lets you access context from anywhere in your component tree.

# What is the difference between useRef and useState ?

The useRef hook is similar to the useState hook, but it does not cause the component to re-render when the ref object is updated.

```jsx
import React, { useRef, useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const ref = useRef();

  return (
    <div>
      <div ref={ref}>Hello</div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the ref object is created using the useRef hook. The ref object is then passed to the div element, which allows us to access the DOM node of the div element using the ref.current property.

The count state is created using the useState hook. When the button is clicked, the count state is updated using the `setCount()` function, which causes the component to re-render.

# Difference between `useMemo()` and `useCallback()` ?

useMemo and useCallback are both hooks in React that help optimize the performance of functional components by memoizing values or functions. Let's break down their differences in simple terms:

useMemo: This hook is used to memoize a value and recompute it only when its dependencies change. It takes a function and an array of dependencies as arguments. The function is executed initially and whenever any dependency in the array changes. The result of the function is stored and returned as the memoized value.


```jsx
import React, { useMemo } from 'react';

const MyComponent = ({ a, b }) => {
  const sum = useMemo(() => {
    console.log('Computing sum...');
    return a + b;
  }, [a, b]);

  return <div>{sum}</div>;
};
```

In this example, the sum value is memoized using useMemo. The function inside useMemo computes the sum of a and b. If either a or b changes, the function will recompute the sum and update the memoized value. Otherwise, it will use the previously memoized value without recomputing.

useCallback: This hook is used to memoize a function and return the same instance of the function until its dependencies change. It takes a function and an array of dependencies as arguments. The function is memoized and returned as a callback. The callback will remain the same unless any of the dependencies change.

```jsx
import React, { useCallback } from 'react';

const MyComponent = ({ onClick }) => {
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    console.log('Button clicked!');
    onClick();
  }, [onClick]);

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;
};
```

In this example, the handleClick function is memoized using useCallback. The function is defined inline and will be memoized. If the onClick dependency changes, the memoized function will be updated. Otherwise, it will return the same function instance, preventing unnecessary re-renders of child components that receive handleClick as a prop.

To summarize, useMemo is used to memoize a value and recomputes it when dependencies change, while useCallback is used to memoize a function and return the same function instance unless dependencies change. Both hooks help optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-computations or re-renders.

# Virtualization

Virtualization is a technique used to render only the components that are currently visible on the screen. Instead of rendering the entire list of components, React renders only the ones in the current view. When dealing with long lists or large datasets, rendering all components at once can lead to performance issues. Virtualization helps in improving performance by rendering only the components that are needed, based on the user's scroll or view.

# Reconcialiation

Reconciliation is the process through which React updates the UI to match the most recent state of the components. React compares the new virtual representation of the component tree with the previous one and makes the necessary updates to reflect the changes. Efficient reconciliation ensures that the UI stays in sync with the application state without causing unnecessary re-renders. This is crucial for maintaining a smooth user experience and optimal performance.

## How It Works:
- **Diffing Algorithm:** React uses a diffing algorithm during reconciliation. It compares the new and old virtual trees, identifying the differences or changes.
- **Minimal Updates:** React aims to make the smallest number of updates necessary to bring the UI to the desired state. It doesn't re-render the entire component tree but only the parts that have changed.

In summary, virtualization helps in rendering only what's necessary for the current user view, and reconciliation ensures that the UI is efficiently updated based on changes in the component tree. Together, they contribute to creating fast and responsive user interfaces, especially in applications dealing with dynamic or large datasets.


# What is a HOC in react ?

In React, a Higher Order Component (HOC) is a pattern that allows you to reuse component logic by wrapping a component with a function. The HOC takes a component as an argument and returns a new component with additional props or behavior.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const Message = ({ text }) => {
  return <div>{text}</div>;
};

export default Message;

```

Now, we want to create a Higher Order Component that adds a timestamp to the message and passes it as a prop to the original Message component.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const withTimestamp = (WrappedComponent) => {
  return (props) => {
    const timestamp = new Date().toLocaleString();
    return <WrappedComponent {...props} timestamp={timestamp} />;
  };
};

const Message = ({ text, timestamp }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>{text}</p>
      <p>Timestamp: {timestamp}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

const MessageWithTimestamp = withTimestamp(Message);

export default MessageWithTimestamp;
```

In this example, we have created the `withTimestamp` Higher Order Component that takes the Message component as an argument and returns a new component. The new component has the original Message component as a child but with an additional timestamp prop.

Now, wherever you want to use the Message component with the timestamp feature, you can use `MessageWithTimestamp` instead:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import MessageWithTimestamp from './MessageWithTimestamp';

const App = () => {
  return <MessageWithTimestamp text="Hello, world!" />;
};

export default App;
```


Now, when rendering the App component, it will display the message with the added timestamp:

```jsx
Hello, world!
Timestamp: 7/31/2023, 12:34:56 PM
```

## How does hooks replace Higher order components ?

In React, Higher Order Components (HOCs) have been a popular way to share behavior between components or enhance component functionality. However, with the introduction of React Hooks, there is an alternative and more flexible approach to achieve similar results without the need for HOCs.

React Hooks allow you to add state and other React features to functional components, which were previously only possible with class components. Hooks are functions **that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features** from function components. The most commonly used hook is the useState hook, which allows you to add state to a functional component.

By using hooks, you can achieve the same functionality as HOCs, but with a simpler and more concise syntax. Hooks provide a way to reuse stateful logic between components without introducing unnecessary complexity. Hooks also promote a more functional programming style, making it easier to reason about the component's behavior and test it in isolation.

For example, let's say you have a component that needs to manage a local state and handle some side effects, such as fetching data from an API. With HOCs, you might need to create separate HOCs for state management and side effects and then wrap your component with those HOCs. This can lead to a higher level of nesting and harder-to-read code.

With hooks, you can achieve the same result using the useState and useEffect hooks directly within your functional component. The state can be managed using the useState hook, and side effects can be handled using the useEffect hook. This approach keeps the code self-contained and eliminates the need for extra layers of abstraction.

Here's an example to demonstrate how hooks can replace HOCs:

```jsx
// Higher Order Component (HOC) approach
const withDataFetching = (WrappedComponent) => {
  class WithDataFetching extends React.Component {
    // HOC manages state and side effects
    state = {
      data: null,
      isLoading: true,
      error: null,
    };

    componentDidMount() {
      // Fetch data and update state accordingly
      fetchData()
        .then(data => this.setState({ data, isLoading: false }))
        .catch(error => this.setState({ error, isLoading: false }));
    }

    render() {
      const { data, isLoading, error } = this.state;

      // Renders the wrapped component with the fetched data, loading state, and error
      return (
        <WrappedComponent data={data} isLoading={isLoading} error={error} />
      );
    }
  }

  return WithDataFetching;
};

// Usage of the HOC
const MyComponent = ({ data, isLoading, error }) => {
  // Render the component based on the fetched data, loading state, and error
  return (
    // JSX rendering here
  );
};

const WrappedComponent = withDataFetching(MyComponent);

// Functional Component with Hooks approach
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [isLoading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch data and update state accordingly
    fetchData()
      .then(data => {
        setData(data);
        setLoading(false);
      })
      .catch(error => {
        setError(error);
        setLoading(false);
      });
  }, []);

  // Render the component based on the fetched data, loading state, and error
  return (
    // JSX rendering here
  );
};
```

As you can see, the hooks approach eliminates the need for a separate HOC and provides a more straightforward way to manage state and side effects directly within the functional component. This simplification and encapsulation of logic make hooks a powerful replacement for HOCs in many cases.

# Pure Components

Pure components always render the same output for the same set of props and state. They are predictable and don't introduce side effects during rendering. Examples include components extending `React.PureComponent` or functional components using `React.memo`.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const PureExample = React.memo(({ value }) => (
  <div>{value}</div>
));
```

# Impure Components
Impure components may have side effects during rendering, relying on external data or performing asynchronous operations. Their output can vary even with the same props and state. Examples include components without React.memo or those involving AJAX requests and global state modifications.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const ImpureExample = ({ value }) => {
  // Impure component with potential side effects
  return <div>{value}</div>;
};
```

export default ({children}) => <div className="prose md">{children}</div>
