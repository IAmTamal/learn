//! QUESTION : https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/
//! LEETCODE MEDIUM

//* Description -> Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

//& Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
//& Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
//& Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].

//^ first we add the first interval to the merged list ðŸ‘‰ int[] current_interval = intervals[0]; merged.add(current_interval);
//^ Here, current_interval is an array in itself
//^ notice that then we start the for loop, the value of current_interval has not changed. So whatever changes we do the value of the current interval, it will be refelected in the merged list.

//^ We then come to [2,6]
//^ so after a while [1,3] becomes [1,6] as 2<3
//^ Current list ðŸ‘‰ [{1,6}]

//^ so if we go to [8,10] , it is not possible to merge. So we add it to the merged list. 

//^ Current list ðŸ‘‰ [{1,6} {8,10}]

//^ so now we go to [15,18] , it is not possible to merge with [8,10] because 15 > 10. So we add it to the merged list.
//^ Current list ðŸ‘‰ [{1,6} {8,10} {15,18}]

//^ time complexity (we are not sorting the array): O(n)
//^ space complexity : O(n)
